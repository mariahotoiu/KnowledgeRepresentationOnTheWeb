Jim came was pleasant however told me he wasn't able to  open my drain and it would cost me between $2500-$5800 depending on where the blockage was. He didn't have equipment with him to locate the clog nor did he have a camera to see what the clog was. Paid $335 for that news. It would have been more had I not had an online coupon.  

I called the dreaded Rotor Rooter and not only did they open the drain in less than 30 minutes,  they costed less, only $300.  They were able to locate the blockage and the fix will only be the tune of $1700.  Because he had proper equipment to locate the problem area he knew how deep and where it was located.  I was advised that I should have only been charged a service call fee verses the fee for the service that was not performed.  Seeing that if they weren't able to perform I would have only been charged $70.  

I talked with Tim the general manager and he said he would talk with the owner.  That has been almost two weeks and he will not return my phone call now.  I know we think that the bigger company may cost us more but it's not the case with Rotor Rooter. They give free estimates with upfront pricing. They show you the price list so you know the price you are charged verses a ball park figure. 

Needless to say I will never refer nor use AAA again.""" ;

He apologized for the misunderstanding, and advised me that the recently hired plumber sent to the house made a mistake on the charge. He gave me a refund of $350.00. I have updated my rating to three stars because at least the owner cares enough about his business to rectify a mistake. 

**UNREASONABLE PRICING**. I was charged $729 for removing a toilet and unclogging the toilet drain. Work that I found out the next day should of cost at most $450.00 

I called AAA City plumbing based on good reviews.  I had an emergency plumbing issue with my rental property on New Years day.  Over the phone I was quoted at $139 for a plumber to come out and assess the issue.  Upon arriving and assessing the issue I was then quoted at $769.00 to remove a toilet and unclog the drain using an electric rooter.  Unfortunately, because of the $139 assessment fee I thought I would lose if I didn't take care of the issue right then and there, and because this was my rental property which required more immediate attention I hesitantly agreed to what seemed to an unreasonably high price for the amount of work to be done.  The technician was at my rental for approximately 45 minutes at most.   Thinking I had been charged to much, I decided to call a few other plumbing companies in the area to check comparisons on the work done and get a price range for this type of work.  I was quoted between $200-$450 by three different companies.  The most expensive estimate was based on what the plumber told me was worst case scenario.  I called AAA City Plumbing to discuss what appeared to be either a mistake in pricing or gauging due to the holiday.  They advised me that this was their price and failed to provide me with an itemized bill of the work that was done.""" ;

They came same day and replaced our water heater.  They did not give price beforehand over the phone but were able to give it 30 seconds into looking at the old water heater, that was a little frustrating.  Service man was nice but the price seems steep now that I have looked around more.  FYI: $2,550 for a 40 gallon water heater replacement and the $150 coupon on the site was allegedly included in that.  Receipt did not break out charges.  What drove me to Yelp this is that when I went to pay there was a 3% credit card fee...I understand the need for that at a 7/11 but that seems ridiculous for a larger expense.

UPDATE:  I was annoyed by the 3% charge so I called the main line and asked generally if they charge anything extra to use a credit card.  She said "No".  I advised that I had been charged 3% yesterday and she said "Yes, that is what we charge for credit card".

I learned my lesson.  Know the hourly rate before getting someone to come out.  All of this work is based on the hourly rate and some companies like to pad their hourly rates in case their employee is not as fast as the market.

Anyone who took AP Microecon in high school would do a better job running Alliant Energy Center operations. Rather than charging reasonable prices to attract more diverse customers, AEC charges exorbitant prices to a shrinking pool. The problem with this strategy is that you alienate the small base who don't return and do not recommend the experience to others. 

Their pricing is highly inflated given that nicer venues like the Kohl Center and Camp Randall are a stone's throw away. They're definitely in a league of their own compared to AEC's "rustic" experience. 

Parking = $7
Hot dog = $4
Reg Beer = $6

The West lobby had maybe three overhead lights on and only one window for Will Call, which had a line 10-people deep. The other two ticketing windows had no customers and they refused to issue Will Call tickets. 

The public areas (and bathrooms) are ideal for a slasher film or Walking Dead location: off-yellow painted walls offset the intensely sharp fluorescent lighting with a repeating pattern of dark stairwells and rolled-down metal gates manned by elderly ushers.

Perhaps a new business opportunity to pay the electricity bills? Or you can just start charging $4.50 for hot dogs next year and call it a day.""" ;

It's not the most accessible place but the staff are helpful to get folks in to where they need to go.  Seats are usually in good repair.  There can be a couple seats that are a bit wonky at times, and then you just move your group over one seat.  The bathrooms were relatively clean at the time I got to them near the end of the show.

Inside the venue, there really isn't a bad place to seat, especially when Marcus and the guys went to the back area to play three acoustic songs .  Sound quality for this show was really good.  I know I had been to some shows that did not sound this good.  I will chalk that up to poor sound mixers.  There was good security around to assist folks or to card the young looking folks for beer purchases.

Outside the building, parking is always a dice game.  I usually come in from Olin and that gate is closed 70% of the time.  It was open at street entrance on this night so I went down and found the gate closed near the parking lot.  I was bummed.  I went in the next available gate and had to park on Willow Island.  For seven bucks, I prefer to park on asphalt.  But at that point, I was just happy to get parked and get in the admissions line.

It's not my favorite concert venue but I will go there if my band is playing there.  And seeing Mumford and Sons was totally worth that night!""" ;

In addition, the Coliseum is very easy to navigate. There are only 3 stories. There were no long stairs, thank goodness. While inside, it seemed a tad dated but clean. There are plenty of men's and women's restrooms on each floor. 

I just wished there were hand rails when going up to the nose bleeds section. I felt bad for the older women that took almost 10 minutes to walk down or the guys that tripped walking up and almost fell backwards.

My most recent couple of trips have been for hockey, supporting our new Madison Capitols team. The games I've been to haven't been super well attended, but it's fun nonetheless, maybe because it reminds me of when I would go as a kid and roam the place like I owned it.

Concessions are moderately priced - I believe it's $4.50 for a soft pretzel with cheese, and a similar price for a soda - not cheap, but also not nearly as high as many similar venues. The beer is where they get you ($6 for a 12oz can), but if you're heading to a Capitols game you can take advantage of their $1 beer nights.

You're not going to get anything fancy when you attend an event on the Alliant grounds, but I've never had a bad time there. Embrace the dated, 60s quality of the Coliseum and enjoy a big-ticket outing for a pretty reasonable price.""" ;

Parking can be designated as free or paid but there's an outline of what type of event gets this. 

I appreciate the street light that has been installed in lieu of sheriff's directing traffic - the automated lights are weight sensitive so if 1 or 1,000 need to enter and exit the Center ... Madison makes it work. 

Easy enough to get to from a Bike path. Across from the Dept. of Revenue. Across the over path from Badger Bowl and a gas station. Same exit as Sheraton on John Nolen and the Clareon Suites. Which the suites are next door and on Rimrock. 

5 stars for being accessible from 2 exits: Rimrock & John Nolen.

All he kept saying is they tired their best. If they were professional tile/ grout cleaners they should have told us that the grout was un-cleanable and not took the job, or put a little effort into it. 
I have never wrote a review before on a business, but this just leaves a sick feeling in my stomach. We are out our money and back to square one. We don't have floors that are any cleaner. I can provide pictures showing "there best job". 
I also have my receipt if he denies I was a customer.

I wish I would have listened to the consumer that left the bad review "Tammy". How are all your customers with a bad review liars. I am moving on and dealing with it. I just hope to save one person the frustration I have experience with you. Good luck with your business.""" ;

I wish I could say that I had the same experience, but I did not. Mike was very amicable and professional on the phone, although there was a small comment about not making much money off these Groupons. I assured him that I would want to do the entire house, although the Groupon only covered a little over 1/2 my square footage. Mike arrived at the scheduled time with an assistant and immediately went to work measuring the house and providing me with an estimate. I was quoted a rate of .60 for the difference in size. All other estimates I had received prior to this were .40 per square foot, so Mike's quote was considerably higher than the going rate in Phoenix. I could have declined to do the remainder of the house - and I should have - but I felt it was still a fair deal overall given the very good rate offered through the Groupon. Mike and his assistant worked through the morning. When they left, Mike assured me that the areas of tile/grout which still appeared dingy would in fact lighten up as they dried. I waited until the next day to assess the situation, and the dingy areas did not lighten up. There is still a distinct discoloration to the grout in various parts of my house. Perhaps Mike did one section and his assistant another???? I can't answer that question because I haven't been able to get an answer from Mike. He has completely ignored my attempts to reach him for the last couple of weeks. I gave two stars as Mike and his assistant were professional and easy to talk to (until I had a complaint and then they disappeared completely!). They also achieved marked improvement to some spots in the house. Overall, I could have spent $200 more, not used a Groupon, and hired the company that just did my neighbors house with much better results." ;

Then walked around a said, \"yea, this is pretty bad, it going to be $.20 extra per sq ft...I believe I told you this over the phone\".  I told him yes, you mentioned that if heavily soiled, it may be.  He then told me, no it's \" $.20 more for everyone\".  BOOM!  I told him, I bought it because I wanted my floors clean and sanitized and they are not heavily soiled.  And again asked him if he was going to honor my purchase.  He again, repeated that it would be more.  I told him, he could complete the job for the paid certificate amount and what he was doing is a blatant scam.  To sell on LIVING SOCIAL for $99. and then arrive and the amount due is more than originally paid (NOTE: in LIVING SOCIAL it reflects the purchase is a $600. value).  In addition, I purchase for 800sq ft. and my area was only 500sq ft..  I told my friend about this and she told me she had the same experience.

Mike told me that he would have to do the same extra treatment to every bit of tile and there would be an additional cost, but all would be clean. I agreed to pay for the extra work. After Mike finished,  I noticed that most of the grout still looked dark. I asked if he had done the extra treatment on all; he assured me yes, that it needed drying time. After several days there were still large areas of darker colored grout.  Mike and I went back and forth with contact and he offered to come back and spend additional time on the grout.  As before, he arrived on time, cleaned up well after, and he spent over an hour scrubbing the stained grout for the second time.  The grout looks so much more evenly colored now, and I am very grateful for the extra attention Mike was willing to provide." ;

Of course I could have bought the $35 tile cleaning coupon for 1200 sf but, I was pretty sure there would be significant \"upsell\". We completely remodeled our kitchen about six months ago including a brand new floor so, I thought $55 was a little expensive for a \"mop\" but wanted to keep it looking good (what was  the  $250 value?  So, the appointed time arrives and they are there on time; a quick look around and they say \"heavily soiled\".  Not likely, maybe \"soiled\" but not HEAVILY soiled. The house was cleaned by a professional maid service just before we left-a week before.  Then they attack the grout by saying not sealed.  Wrong again, I was here when it was sealed-in fact, the grout was sealed twice. While I considered $55 for a routine clean of less than 300sf; a little expensive-I guess there isn't enough profitability to do it without the customary \"upsell\". Well, NO SALE at this house!

This was my first (of many) trip to Bagels on Fire. My family and I were visiting from New York and were all in the mood for a decent bagel for breakfast. I didn't know what to expect from BoF. 

Let me start from when I walked in the door, the selection of bagels on display was amazing. They even had a coconut bagel! I opted for the everything bagel which was truly covered in everything. Topped of with a little cream cheese and it was perfect. I seriously would like to explore all f the different bagels they make here. 

I loved the fact that the bagels were baked in a brick oven this gave them just a hint of crunch on the crust. They toasted my bagels for me too. They staff behind the counter were very helpful. 

I guess my only comment would be that the bagels are on the small side. I ended up having two bagels instead of one. My wife and daughter said they were still hungry after eating their bagels. 

I'm going with four stars, I have to hold back because of the size of the bagels. 

Two solid thumbs up for the taste and the courtesy of the staff. I'll be back!""" ;

Bagels have always been fresh when I've bought them - unlike one place I went to uptown where I think they sold me yesterday's bagels. Gross. 
The owners are super nice and they have a great "made in Canada" story about saving money to open their store etc.

I think it's a great idea and definitely good for the beaches to have a place like this! Unfortunately the bagels we  had on Saturday morning did not meet expectations. I am highly doubtful they were baked fresh that morning, as they were too hard and even though I'd asked for them toasted, they were not warm. The bagels could also have used more seasoning/seeds. Since it's a bagel place, I wasn't expecting too much from their coffee, but was nevertheless disappointed on this front too. I am giving Bagels on Fire three stars because I still love the concept and hope they do improve, and that my experience was a one-time thing." ;

Owners are the nicest people.....and don't be surprised if you open your bag when you get home and they've thrown in a new flavour they're trying out or an extra bagel or two....just because.

They bake every day....all day so you know what you're getting is fresh and it's not unusual for your purchase to be fresh out of the oven.

Looking for a good inexpensive lunch?  This is the place.  5 buck roast beef and swiss on a fresh bagels with lettuce and tomato is 5 bucks and it's plenty.  All sandwich ingredients are fresh...I've never had a bad sandwich from here.  I do have a sandwich bagel shop less than a one minute walk from home but this place is so worth the two block walk that  I just don't go there.

There is some seating, maybe 4 or 5 small tables but most people just come for take-out.  Busiest times are mornings, lunch hour and Sunday until mid-afternoon.  The line-up might be long but they staff for the Sunday rush.....and don't worry if your favourite flavour is out, they'll tell you how many minutes you'll have to wait for a fresh batch straight out of the oven.

Prices are so reasonable....considering the quality and the freshness.  And if you don't mind day-olds.....they also have them on the counter batched in 1/2 dozen bags (not that you'd notice they're day-olds....but what a bargain).

I'm loathe to give away our neighbourhood gem but they are so deserving of the recognition.  

Try it.....you won't be disappointed.""" ;

The bagels:
Cuteness factor = 5.   Tiny but good size for kids.   
Taste = 4.   A bit too sweet.  Some of them are a little too burnt on the outside.  
Chewiness = 3.   Good, but not consistent through out the bagels.  It seems a little under-cooked.   Noticed dough stuck on knife after slicing them in halves.  
Varieties = 5.   Lots of different choices.  

The shop:
Very neat little store front.    No inside seating but there is a bench outside.    Bagels and cream cheese are in full display in their cases.   The blackboard lists all items and prices.   

Services:
Very efficient.   

Summary:   Fairly decent bagels for Toronto, albeit a little smaller.  The kids liked them.  The adults, not so much.""" ;

He said that they don't usually do that but they will try. Well, it was a disaster. They weren't done nearly well enough - not nearly enough to eat. How could they let the wings leave like that - garbage!  I called and he said that he would send the delivery guy back to pick them up and refund my money. 

Well, no show. 

We called and called - no answer. So I decided to personally take them back. When I got there, the lights were off (and before closing time) but they were there. I told them that they weren't answering so I decided to deliver the wings to them for them - the delivery guy was lounging in the back. The owner immediately said that he wasn't going to give me my money back because he told me that they don't usually make them that way. I told him that if he wasn't up for the challenge that he should have told me that he can't do it.  But he continued to say how he wasn't going to give me my money back because he told me.  Obviously not a business man of his word. 

Looking at the other reviews, it looks like I'm not the only one having challenges with these guys. Looks like they are heading for a crash and their arrogant owners aren't helping the situation. 

Too bad because it used to be a really good place with good food. Not so much anymore. You've done it to yourselves guys.""" ;

We had an order of bbq wings, the rocky balboa chillyphilly cheesesteak and the cookout pizza. 

The wings were FANTASTIC and HUGE. Some of the best wings I've had and they were brought out piping hot to start before the pizza. Both of the pizzas were also fantastic. Lots of toppings on both, delicious combinations and cooked to perfection. It's nice to go to a place and try pizzas that are different from your standard pizzas. I love pizzas that have a different base and both of these did. The rocky had a lovely cream base and the cookout had a nice sweet bbq sauce, both went well with the toppings on top. Just fantastic. 

Also we only got smalls and they were quite big for a small. Meaning leftovers that I already can't wait to dig into!

The staff were also incredibly friendly and took the time to chat with us and make us feel right at home. It's nice to go into a restaurant where the staff make you feel welcome and they did exactly that.

Definitely a place I will visit again next time I'm in town and wanting some really good pizza.

Highly recommend this place!""" ;

The saddest part about the pizza is the crust. It is dense in a bad way. And just seems really heavy and not soft at all. I've never seen so many uneaten crusts left on plates. And a lot of the toppings were nowhere near to the end of the crust so it left a lot of uneaten pizza.""" ;

            schema:reviewBody """Sorry to be part of this establishments downtrend reviews but honestly my sweetie and I were hugely disappointed. We ordered a Margherita and a build ur own with mushrooms, hot peppers and onions (or at least we thought the sinew-y, fibrous strings that got caught in our teeth might be onions). I really have to start taking photos but when a new pizza comes home to our place it's like a life size game of Hungry, Hungry Hippos and if I stop to take a photo, I could miss out. Anyway, I'm in sad agreement with some of the other reviewers that either Big House has suffered a few chef changes which often go hand in hand with a slide in the quality or the one reviewer who may have it right that Torontonians really don't know a good pizza or are just too damned polite to say much. 
At any rate, this was our first experience with Big House and we're not likely to give it another try for several reasons. First I must comment on the pleasant ordering experience with the staff on the phone and the warm greeting when picking up the pizza so 5 stars on that front but as we sat waiting for our order I was disturbed to watch as a well meaning employee began sweeping the floors creating airborn dust plumes blowing directly at us and settling on the freshly made pizza which had just been placed on the counter to rest. I was speechless. 
Then the moment of truth as we unboxed the pies at home to find that the custom order was extremely overcooked - even the cheese was a crusty, dried out brown, scant mushrooms and unrecognizable onions covered by a nondescript sauce all atop the mediocre crust. The Margherita was a little better but I was again disappointed to find that there was no fresh mozzarella fior di latte and what may have been a San marzano tomato but now a skimpy dried out few slices of red mush. 

Too bad, so sad that the menu was a far better read than the actual pizzas. 

And so ends my dusty tale of our "pizza unrequited" experience at the Big House.""" ;

            schema:reviewBody """My bf and I were looking for the best pizza in town and the search led us to Big House Pizza. Surprisingly, it's very close to where we live so we decided to give them a try.

The first time we went was for Sir John A. MacDonald day and got the John A. MacDonald pizza, also known as the big mac pizza. We got a small size, which according to the staff, is equivalent to a medium at the big chain pizza places. Although the pizza looked like a mess and unappetizing at all, it tasted extremely good, just like a McDonald's big mac burger, but in pizza form. The pizza crust was cooked perfectly crispy and the toppings complimented each other well. It exceeded our expectation of the pizza.

The second time we tried their pizza, our friend has ordered the Rob "the Jerk" Ford and the Rocky Balboa pizzas. I was excited to try the Rob Ford pizza. When I opened the box to take a slice out, it turns out the slice I was trying to pick up was not cut properly. As I tried to find the cut line on that particular slice, I ended up tearing the pizza and pulled two-fifths of the pizza out. My slice of pizza, is two-fifths of the whole pizza. The pizza was cut VERY unevenly. There was another slice that was about one-fifth of the pizza, another one that is about one-fourth of the pizza and one odd sliver slice in between. I ended up having to eat the ginormous two-fifth slice by myself. Although the pizza tasted ok, we were disappointed that the pizza didn't have more chicken on it. The smaller slices of the Rob Ford pizza had little to no chicken at all. Given that the pizza was not cut evenly, my ginormous pizza slice probably took most of the chicken from the pizza. The jalapeno cream sauce didn't taste like jalapeno. But it was a very cheesy pizza.

The Rocky Balboa pizza is pretty much a philly cheese steak pizza. This pizza tasted better than the Rob Ford pizza but the same thing happened when my bf tried to take a slice of it. He grabbed a large two-fifth slice out. Also the toppings on the Rocky Balboa was not distributed evenly. All the toppings were concentrated in the middle of the pizza and there was nothing but cheese about 2 inches from the crust. Also both pizza crusts felt a bit doughy, like it's not cooked well enough.

We were a bit disappointed during our second try at this is pizza place as it was listed on Blog To as one of the best pizzas in Toronto. We might come back a third time to see if it's just an inconsistency issue. Both times we ordered the pizza to go.""" ;

Everything about my experience with Big House Pizza was top notch. Let's start with the food. 

I ordered a pizza for delivery. They have a minimum $20 order for delivery, which is honestly no big deal. Just order a large pie. You'll eat a large pie (and if you won't, people will help you). It's that good. I wanted something simple, and although they have some stellar-looking gourmet options on the menu, I went with the Jimmy "Margharittaville" Buffett. My pizza arrived and I gasped as it came out of the carrier. It was steaming hot! Steamy! Straight from the oven to my door! It's the stuff dreams are made of. I am so sick of getting warm delivery. 

The crust was dense, but I found it perfectly cooked - not undercooked, not too chewy. It also has really great flavour. Reminded me of the bread I used to eat in Germany. Salty with olive undertones. The toppings were fresh and well dispersed on the pie. I would have liked a bit more basil but that would be my only improvement. 

Aside from the pizza I feel I couldn't do this review justice with commenting on the service. Absolutely perfect. I called in without knowing where the delivery zone was and had a great chat with the guy on the phone. Living in the east end is usually a hit or miss for delivery joints and I was thrilled to hear I could get delivery to my place. The dude on the phone also let me know about some recent specials and took the time to enquire how I had heard about them. It was a genuinely great chat - which you normally don't have when ordering pizza. And the guy who delivered (I believe the man on the phone referred to him as the 'Dragon') was friendly and helpful. He even stopped my cat from escaping - which happens all too often. 

As I eat my pizza I'm becoming more and more sad. First, because I am starting this silly clean eating challenge tomorrow and second because I am moving out of the delivery zone in two weeks. I guess that just means I'll have to make some trips to the Danforth in the future....""" ;

Fresh ingredients go a long way in the pizza kitchen, and I hope they continue on this route in the future.  

Their unique toppings, amusing names and excellent customer service put this over the top and add an extra star for me.

I wanted to order more of a Queen M style but heard that if you're ordering many pizzas at once, you run the risk of it getting cold (plus you have to pick up yourself). Big House Pizza was hot, yummy & a hit!" ;

I don't like giving a mediocre review when the owner is so nice... he even shook my hand and introduced himself. A very nice guy.  Here it goes.... The place is pleasant and definitely better than Librettos down the street but as far as pizza is concerned, I would say it lives up to Toronto style pizza, which is not good. It is next to impossible to get good pizza in Toronto and this place while better than some lives up to Toronto's reputation and does little to improve on Toronto's reputation for pizza, which is not good.

We've ordered Big House numerous times and have had mixed experiences.

- Unique pizzas! Our favourites are The Cookout and the Sir John Macdonald
- Wings are large and flavourful 
- Delivery guys are cool. 

The Bad:
- Inconsistency. Have had excellent experiences and then recently had an order where the pizza looked rushly made and the wings were very overdone and under-seasoned.

I've had to ask with every order that the toppings be spread to the edge, otherwise they all get lumped in the middle and there's a 2.5" giant blank crust around the edge. They've met this request a dozen times and won us back.

Made the same "to the edge" request tonight. Regardless, our Sir John A had everything in the middle and giant empty crust at edge. I called to tell them - I was not looking for another pizza or discount or anything - and was told by the manager on duty that is the way the crust is and I don't understand "pizza physics" and how yeast works. "Pizza physics"?? Really??? They've done it awesome a dozen times and now it's my fault for not understanding "pizza physics"? This is NOT how a customer should be treated, especially by the manager.

I might give them one more chance. The pizza has improved but the rude customer service makes me want to take my cash to the amazing old-school place down the block instead.""" ;

These guys are Amazing,  haven't even come close to letting me down and I frequent them often enough but not half as often as I would like. 
Pizza wise,  these guys deal in the most wonderfully soft and buttery thin crusts possible,  seriously I am not sure how they do it but the crust alone is worth the visit,  as far as toppings...  Well...  Let's just sat they are unique but in a completely epic and amazing way,  check out the "John A MacDonald" or as it is lovingly referred the "Big Mac"  flavour combinations you would never expect to work work so perfectly it reshapes your whole idea of what pizza is. 
If pizza isn't your thing they still have you covered,  aside from the most perfect Italian eatery type sandwiches your taste buds have even experienced they also have salads. 
My favorite? Well I'm glad you asked,  is the Jerk Chicken Caesar.  Seriously for a couple of white boys they really get the concept of jerk, incredible.  always perfect heat always fresh while you watch. 
I grabbed one today and while I normally grab jerk but this time I was lucky.  
This time there was a special,  in-house Applewood smoked cured lamb shoulder seared perfectly,  it fell apart and was perfect.  Seriously amazing. 
Try these guys if you are in the area you will NOT be disappointed.

When the pizza is done right it is easily one of the best, but it seems to be a gamble. It may completely depend on who's making it. I've had issues from sparse toppings to the crust being burnt.

I was so glad that I discovered Big House Pizza, so let's get into that.

The Pizza I had was the Rocky Balboa Philly Chilli Cheese Steak Pizza.  It featured a nice thin crust that was just at the right moisture level, the cheese was ooey gooey good, along with a nice crunch in the crust that didn't leave my mouth dry after gobbling it up.  I'd have to say the pizza sauce was the highlight of this pizza.  I've never had a fettucine based white sauce on a pizza before - I can't quite describe it as it was brought all the ingredients together as it was the last thing I tasted before swallowing my already gigantic bites (think Michaelangelo swallowing pizza slices...)

Only thing is they undercook for my liking, you might want to ask for well done.

But seriously this is REALLY good pizza, and it is CHEAPER than all of the other nearby haunts we used to order from (Pizza Nova, Pizzaolio, Pizzaville) that end up closer to $30 for a well-toppinged pie. Plus they are nice. I like when people are pleasant on the phone.

That it was not. Considering the reviews and price tag the toppings were sparse and the crust was very doughy and actually slightly raw in the center. We called for pickup and were told 25 minutes and ended up waiting an extra 15. I don't mind if it takes 40, just tell me that so I'm not standing around when I'm calling for pickup to clearly avoid exactly that.

While waiting, we enjoyed the d√©cor of portraits of famous people who have been to jail aka the Big House (GET IT?!) and also heard every other order asking for a pizza well done. Would definitely get that/recommend that next time, since apparently that means 'cooked through'.

The restaurant itself is very spacious. They had mug shots of many A list actors on their wall. It's clean and there are several tables available for groups.

I walked to the nearest bixi stop to pick up a bike after dinner out, but the station at King and Jarvis wasn't working, so I had to walk about 10 minutes to the next bixi stop. I biked home to the Annex, but when I got home, the bike rack nearest me was full, as were the next THREE locations nearest to me. I had to bike all the way back to campus to return the bike, and then walk back north home (in high heels!). That added another 25 minutes to the trip. The entire trip ended up taking me over an hour. It would have been cheaper and faster to take the TTC home. I want to like it, and I'm going to give it another try, but I found it a really frustrating process.

I hope Bixi will improve, and that they will increase the number of locations. Right now I find it quite limiting as it only is downtown, the exact same places where it is REALLY easy to get to by subway. I'm looking forward to them hopefully expanding to Liberty Village, Trinity Bellwoods, and the Ossington/Dundas strip... the places where you have to bus to, and therefor the places that I'm more likely to bike.

Bixi isn't really useful if you're trying to go anywhere north of Bloor, west of Spadina, or east of Yonge. I think a lot of people don't really get the pricing scheme exactly - you pay $5.95 for unlimited 24 hour use, but only for the first 30 minutes per ride. Extra time on the bike is going to cost more. 

The stations are kind of tucked away, and sometimes hard to find. A "Yonge" station will actually be tucked away 100 metres in some side street off Yonge.

The bikes are hugeee and clunky and not at all fun to ride - they have the high handlebars and low seats reminiscent of those beachy Schwinn Cruisers, but its not necessarily something I feel safe riding on the street in rush hour traffic. Turn radius sucks, and I feel like, to some degree, Bixi encourages riding without a helmet.

Toronto has an excellent system of making bicycles accessible for public transportation.   For $5/day (or less, if you get a monthly or yearly pass), you get permission to take a bike from any of the racks, which are placed all over the downtown area, and use it.  If you return it to any other rack within 30 minutes, there is no additional fee.  Be careful:  The system is designed to encourage short trips, so there is a hefty fee if you ride the bike all day.  We timed ourselves, returned the bikes every 25 minutes, and got new bikes.  

We rode all over the downtown, along the waterfront, to Chinatown, to the Kensington Market.  It was a wonderful way to explore the city.

The bikes are big and clunky, but that's OK for slow touring through a city.  No complaints here.  They are cool-looking,and lots of people greeted us and shouted "Bixi Bikes!" as we peddled along.  Seats are easily adjustable for height (I am very tall), and there are three speeds, plenty for riding in urban Toronto.  There's a blinking red light in the back that is powered by a generator run by the pedals.

We found plenty of Bixi stations, located pretty much anywhere we wanted to go.  Each station had a detailed map, so we could easily figure out where we would go next and where we would find the next Bixi station.   Some reviews say that it can be hard to find an open spot in the racks to return your bike when you are done, but we didn't have any problems at all.

Altogether, this is a great way for a city to make itself accessible, reduce pollution, and promote fitness.  Good job, Toronto!""" ;

So we biked the city for maybe a couple hours and were charged 43 dollars because we didn't check it in every 30 minutes and re-check it out in order not to pay overage fees. It is so shitty.

            schema:reviewBody """Brilliant. I tried it out last Spring when it started out and I ended up compulsively using it to make little treks across downtown over the summer. Strangely, I didn't get the annual membership because I was planning on traveling for a few months. And yet the $5 for 24 hours of use was still *cheaper* than a round trip using the TTC, which would be $3 x 2 (cash fare). It's awesome to see BIXI spreading like wildfire to other cities across North America, including New York, Boston and DC. Kudos to BIXI and kudos to the City of Montreal for investing in this brilliant concept (Montreal mismanagement aside).

Having said all that, it must be said that riders **MUST READ the instructions carefully** to understand how the fee structure works. Many new riders fume when they rent a bike over 30 minutes and get charged higher fees than they thought they signed up for. The BIXI system is designed to promote short trips between docking stations. So in place of driving or jumping on a bus or streetcar for $3 for a short trip across downtown, one might choose to jump on a BIXI bike to save money and get some exercise. **But** the fee structure is meant to discourage long meandering day tours through city. After all, the bikes have to continuously recirculate within the BIXI network. So as long as you keep a single trip at 30 minutes or less between docking points, you will not have to pay anything over the initial fee. But over the 30 minutes and the meter starts running, like a taxi cab. So again, read the instructions!! I don't think they company intends to rip people off, it's kinda hard to make this kind of thing work if you think about it. I think the BIXI system is ingenious.

It is almost essential, to have a smartphone with a data plan and one of the BIXI bike apps. I've used Spotcycle and it works great. It shows a live Google map of all the stations annotated with how many bikes and how empty docking stations are available at each. The toronto.bixi.com website also provides the same map and information.""" ;

Coming from the GTA, bixi seems like a heaven-sent gift, since i don't have to haul my bike down from York Region, and let's face it TTC and YRT aren't as bike friendly as can be.

So, bixi Toronto, at least on the surface, seems fantastic, with tons of pick-up and drop-off stations dotted throughout the core. It's relatively cheap, with a $250 deposit and about $5 a full day, in half hour intervals. Perfect for running errands. The bikes aren't bad-looking either, they're 3-speed bikes, with a little sort of not really basket thingie, that you can put stuff on and tie down.

But the payment kiosks and the implementation of it... well, the only thing i can say is give it some time. 

Because yesterday was Doors Open Toronto (love, love, love this annual event), and I was downtown for the event, I thought about giving bixi a try... the first station (Yonge & Gould) I went to... there was an issue with the screen; so I walked to another station (Adelaide & King)... there was an issue with that screen as well; so i walked another one (King & Jarvis) ... the screen was working but it wouldn't print out the unlock receipt;  so I went to another one(Spadina/King)... where the screen worked but it had issues... so out of 4 times attempting to try bixi I came out empty handed... and it wasn't for lack of trying... since I went from Jarvis to Spadina and from Dundas to King to try this; which if you look at it, was pretty much the entire zone. 

The bixi hotline is fairly helpful as well as the app they have for it, which tells you how many bike are available and where they are, but until they sort out the issues they have with the payment kiosks... I'm going to have to say so-long bixi, at least for now...""" ;

We went to Ossington between Dundas and Queen (a popular neighborhood area still very much in the city) and there was not a station to be had.  Odd.

We give Toronto ZERO stars for bikeability. 
 
We are experienced cyclists and have cycled all over the US and in Europe.  Though there are a lot of people cycling in Toronto, I must say they are brave, and I felt like one of those brave souls.  In the days before we checked out Bixi I found myself wincing numerous times at the situations I saw Toronto cyclists navigating in.  In Toronto there are barely any bike lanes, traffic is whizzing by quickly, it is impossible to tell where to ride with the exception of a few select blocks that actually have sharrows (which never work btw) or actual bike lanes.  I felt like I was in all those bad videos and pictures one sees of conditions never to bicycle in.  I was so glad at the end of the day to check my last bike in and walk on my own two feet.

If Bixi is going to survive in Toronto, they need to work with the city of Toronto to make cycling easier and SAFER, install more way-finding sings, provide maps for users who do not have international cell phone plans, and familiarizing hotels with how to share information about their system.  Having a bike alternative for our tired legs was a great idea in theory, using it in practice not a great reality.""" ;

I got the yearly membership, which I think is the way to go. All you have to so is stick your key in the slot, and you get your bike. There is a convenient basket in the front of the bike to store whatever.

Typical complaints about Bixi are that a) racks can be full or empty and b) you only get the bike for 30 minutes for free (when you have the yearly membership). However, after two months of use, neither of these things has been a problem for me. I have never encountered an empty rack when I wanted a bike, and the one or two times a rack was full when I wanted to return, I just went to the next one down the street.

I planned ahead and ordered a Bixi key (got it shipped to my cousin's place).

As I'm not from Toronto, I bought an occasional membership ($5) which allows you to just put in your key and then it automatically charges your credit card $5 (for 24 hour use!).

It seems like stations are reasonably close together in the downtown area.  As others have stated, it would be helpful to have stations visible from popular streets and it would be helpful to have stations well marked.

We tried to go to one station that we never found.  We were on the right corner, but the station must have been hidden.

It was also a bit confusing that you put your credit card in every time you want a new bike, but we figured that out quickly enough.

We did make the mistake though of using the Bixi website instead of the app to locate Bixi stations. The website isn't optimized for mobile, and perhaps I'm blind, but from the small screen on my phone, didn't see any prompts to download the app, so it was laughable to think of how much easier our experience could have been if only we'd thought of looking for the app from the get-go.

If I didn't already have a bike, I would be using it more often. I've only used it once. 

It was Halloween night, and coming from Queen St, with no cab in sight and it was 3am. I started walking, and realized it's REALLY FAR from Bloor Street. 
So I picked up a Bixi bike on Beverly and biked home. 

The bright flashing lights also was really nice and made me feel safe. 

Next morning, I had to brunch at Yonge and Welleley. I have a bike stop just a block from my place, so I hopped on and went on my way. It was great! No need for subway, great fresh air and super convenient. 

Now that they keep moving the bike stations around, I would try to plan your route ahead to make sure that there is one. Also use http://ridethecity.com/toronto (Ride the City) to plan which streets to take.

During a TTC strike or subway delay, this would be a great alternative.

Dear Toronto Bixi:

I have been in Toronto 3 times since I received my Bixi key and have only been able to use your system for 4 trips, though I have needed it for many more. As a Montrealer, I have to wonder whether or not you in Toronto want your Bixis to be seen and used, or if you prefer to hide them out of sight? It is near impossible to spot a Bixi station, and the ones that are around are placed far from the major arteries that a) would attract attention of non-users to entice them to subscribe or try the system and b) are extremely inconvenient for those of us who need a bike or want to return the one we have. 

Wouldn't it be great if the bixi docking stations were visible along Yonge, University, Spadina, and Church Streets? At various levels, say along Bloor, Wellesley, College, Dundas, Queen, King, Front, and Queens Quay? A nice simple grid of stations! Intuitive. Anyone would know exactly where to get the bikes and the walk time to and from the station would be minimized because they would be well spaced out!

I am attaching a photo of your "25 York Street" station, that is hidden in an alcove of a wide open pedestrian area, and certainly NOT on York Street. 
The second photo is of one user and one stranger searching their smartphones for the nearest Bixi station. We spent almost 10 minutes looking, and finally gave up. I drove to the spot where the girl in the picture picked up hers. Way out of my way.

I am incredibly disappointed in the Toronto system; and I am someone who is very pleased with the one in Montreal, which I have subscribed to since the first months of its operation. 

Lastly, and most importantly given my complaint, please send me 2 copies of the Toronto map of the bixi stations. I don't have a smartphone and I could really use the maps to save me from an endless search of the city.""" ;

1.  The rental instructions are easily misunderstood so that you think you are paying just $5 for the bike for the day.  This is not right.  It is $5 plus the hourly rate.  We had two bikes for about 2 hours - it was $40 total.  Maybe that is reasonable, but I thought it was going to be $10 total.  The pricing/signs could be made much clearer.  I didn't stand there studying the fine print, but I'm a pretty decent reader/interpreter of instructions and this was just totally confusing to me.

2.  The $250 deposit is placed on "hold" on your car for a REALLY long time.  I rented on Friday, May 25.  $500 deposit for two bikes.  I returned the bikes within 2 hours.  I called Bixi to ask when I would get the deposit back - they told me June 4!   This is a crazy amount of time to hold money! 

I really enjoyed the experience of renting the bikes, but the above two facts were like punches in the gut.  Maybe if all of this had been made clear up front, I would have still rented the bikes and enjoyed it, but getting socked with these "surprises" afterward was very negative.""" ;

            schema:reviewBody """My bike was sadly stolen from a very secure interior spot years ago. It didn't turn up in the bust Igor's bike-stealing ring, either. 
So, I bikelessly walk the city... until Bixi. 
I joined just after they set down their first stand and have a 1 year membership. I'm lucky enough to live and work in the narrow service corridor between Jarvis and Spadina. 
This has cut my commute to work by more than 5 minutes and it's only 20 minutes to begin with. I really enjoy taking the bixi to the waterfront, the market (the ONE stand west of Spadina is in the Kensington Market Park), and where else do I take it? Oh, right, I CAN'T take it to College Street, Trinity Bellwoods, St Clair and Bathurst, Queen East or a number of other bike-friendly hoods.
I also sometimes need to check my App before I leave the house or work because often during the 8am-9am time there are no bikes where people live, and no place to park it after 9am near where people work. If I leave work at 5pm, there are no bikes in the University/College area in 4 different racks! 
So, there will be problems, but with more service areas, and a closer eye on the full/empty racks, I hope this lives up to its potential and gets people out on the road again. 
Wear your helmets!""" ;

I'm glad it's finally arrived in Toronto. My friend and I checked the map for docking stations today, and there seems to be one almost every other block from bloor to front, and between jarvis and university (?).

Here is how the payment system works.
You pay a flat rate to have access to the bike a set period of time ($5 for 24 hours).
You can take out a bike at any time during those 24 hours. The first 30 minutes are always free. Then you get charged increasing rates every half hour.
Basically, check in your bike every half hour to avoid paying anything except for the flat rate activation fee.

My one problem with bixis is that they are large, clunky, and heavy. They're not enjoyable to ride, and they are not fun for cruising. They're difficult to maneuver while pushing, and difficult to steer while riding.

Use them for transportation downtown, but if you're looking more for an enjoyable ride, bixi is not a good option.""" ;

He did call me back and I told him my problem. Then he said, "how about you call back when we are open"...

I asked him why he had a 24-hour service if no one can respond within one hour which a typical on-call person should be able to do. 

Then he replied with an attitude: "no one will be there til 8am anyways and do you want me to charge you $149 dollars?"

I hate when people infer that I don't have money to pay or assume my budget without having seen my finances. 

He added. "Do you want people to drop everything just for you???" 

In my mind ... am like no sir but I do want you to uphold your company's promise of 24 hour service ...duh! Also... why da hell are you on call if everyone gotta wait til company to open to call??? You might as well save Your boss money by being off duty. 

Anyways we didn't have a friendly conversation.

Anyways very poor customer service and their advertisement is misleading too. 24 hour service should mean someone is able to come out within a reasonable time frame to look at an issue. 

A customer calling off hours is already prepared to pay a hefty price and I wouldn't have called if I didn't think it was an emergency.""" ;

Thankfully, I called Boehmer the other night and Ed happened to be on call. He was the best tech who has ever serviced my home. He was fast, knew what he was doing, went above and beyond and the price was more than reasonable. If you need help with your air-conditioning, make sure you request Ed and you will be delighted with the result. It was after hours and the bill was cheaper than most places who come out during business hours. My air conditioning is working better than ever because he cleaned the unit for me. It's so hard to find an honest company with techs who know what they are doing and I found one here. I can only speak for the great service from Ed.. it depends with these companies who is on call when you need someone. I have only used Boehmer once and I was overly pleased.

The house had never had AC just heat and we were told our existing heater was quite large but they were able to reroute the ductwork some to make it fit which was a lot cheaper than buying a newer, smaller heater. It took them 2 and a half days to finish and they were very professional the entire time - always on time and kept a good pace. We were also mailed a box of cookies a week later as a thank you for our business... That was a surprisingly nice gesture. If you are in the market for a Nest thermostat, they installed ours with no issue or extra cost. I would recommend them to anyone and use them again in the future." ;

3,right after he part was changed , Heat is out ! They decided need a new vault! It didn't work !

Btw, the tech really spend a lot of time on the parking lot, I'm saying 1-2hours.

From light snacks to full meals, from water to liquor and passing through many coffee and tea options, there's definitely something here that will please all. 

The main dining area is separated from the rest area (where the comfy chairs are) via some tempered glass and you get the feeling of being at a restaurant.

Although Budget will rent you a truck for $29.99 a day that does not mean you will not be charged a late fee when you return your truck. That rate is only available if you tell the agent that you will have the truck for the entire day. This is very important. The agent will ask you for a return hour. Give them the latest possible hour that is within their \"day\" window. If you don't and you give them a hour such as five o'clock in the afternoon and you return the truck at anytime later than five o'clock you will receive a late fee of $25. I called their customer service center to dispute the late fee but since I said I would have the truck back by five that day I forfeited my option of using the truck for the whole day. The agent who rented me the truck did not mention this at that time. Personally, I feel this is criminal behavior when corporations such as Budget resort to taking money from their customers in this fashion. The onus is on the renter to uncover the the fees standing in the shadows. I never had this issue with U-Haul." ;

Yes, we were lucky enough to be here on one of the few days when it was warm enough to sit outside. But rather than emulating the mediterranean way of doings things, sitting outside nibbling olives and sipping wine whilst watching the world go by, we sat outside nibbling olives and drinking wine whilst watching the rush-hour traffic build up courtesy of the adjacent roadworks. Not ideal.

Still, you can't say that ¬£15 for a bottle of wine and 3 small tapas-sized plates of nibbles isn't good value for money. It's just that I think I'd rather spend the same money on getting some nice wine and nibbles to enjoy in my flat. Even watching TV whilst we sipped and nibbled would be an improvement on the roadworks.""" ;

There is lots of seating here, and a lot of lunchtime food choices, so lunch hours here are very busy, because it's also all very reasonably priced.

Whether you want an 11's snack, lunch or an afternoon coffee then this place is a good shout.  They do good coffees without them being the price of Starbucks so it is a clear winner.

            schema:reviewBody """Our little Junior Bacon Cheeseburger - aka our 52-lb Beagle named Oshkosh (see picture) - has been coming here for about 2 years.  We use CBW mainly for daycare ($25/day) when he'd otherwise be stuck indoors for more than 8 hours without going outside.  Occasionally we need to board Oshkosh overnight ($39/overnight, day included) when our travel plans absolutely forbids bringing him along with us.

We love Camp Bow Wow's cozy cabin motif all throughout the business - from the lobby decked out with wooden counters and posts, the kennels are called "cabins", the attendants "camp counselors", and the doggies "campers".  Even their webmaster/events coordinator is called the camp "scout".

The play area ia divided into 3 areas including access to their own exclusive outdoor area. This allows the doggies to be divided appropriately by their size and temperament so that no one gets trampled accidentally nor feels too intimidated to play.

CBW's mission is to keep the doggies playing and having fun most of the day and tired out so that they "snooze the night away".  That way overnighting campers don't miss home so much and can sleep more easily in unfamiliar surroundings.  Let me tell ya something - boy do they do a good job!  Picking up Oshie after playing for 10 - 12 hours, our little stinker is down for the count quite often before the car even makes it out of the parking lot!

If you're concerned about the $25/$39 cost it's important to keep in mind that this is an all-inclusive price.  I did the homework before signing up with CBW and found other boarding kennels charge a basic fee far less than $25/$39 but end up nickel-and-diming you for things CBW does without charge.  No extra cost for snacks or feeding overnighters nor fees for interviewing or playing and interacting with your pooch.  In fact, the first day (interview day) at CBW is free and it feels really good to know that their interview process protects our lil' campers by keeping out diseased, dangerous, or flea-infested animals.

Speaking of protecting the doggies, CBW maintains an impressive cleaning regimen in which the play floors are completely mopped with an anti-bacterial solution twice a day (you see this in the cameras, I'll discuss later).  Also, because any infectious disease introduced at camp would quickly run rampant among the campers at play, CBW requires and tracks vaccination records and will give you a friendly heads-up if your little tyke is due.  (CBW doesn't vaccinate except for the 6-month Bordatella on request.)

Walk-in convenience is great!  We've never had a problem with coming in any weekday and adding another Beagle to their collection for the day.  And the 7 PM close time is really good for people like me who spend way too much time at work.  They do encourage making reservations for overnight stays especially as the cabins fill up on holiday weekends.  And they do offer daycare on weekends but shut down during lunch hours. 

Pre-paid package deals (5 and 10-packs) with lower daily rates are offered and they often have monthly specials (i.e. free bath or "spa day" w/package).  Plus they have a special 401-K9 (get it?) program that offers deeper package discounts to companies that participate. 

Extra fees are only for special requests such as baths, nail trimming, or administering the aforementioned 6-month bordatella intranasal vaccination.

We absolutely love their web cameras which you can access during daycare hours (7 am - 7 pm) for free anywhere you have Internet access!   I typically put one of 7 camera views in the background on one of my monitors at work which let's me check on him from time-to-time and see him play.  My wife loves showing the Beagle off to folks at work to the point they ask to see him online if they know he's in daycare that day.

Unfortunately, the $5 smartphone app (run by Online Doggy, not CBW) doesn't provide live-feed to your smartphone, only camera stills refreshed every 15 minutes. 

One of the great things about being able to watch Oshkosh is to see him interact with doggies we would potentially like to foster or adopt!  What better way to see if they'd get along than on their own in a playful environment??

An example of how well CBW protects the welfare of the doggies was in late 2011.  An accidental fire triggered the security sensors which automatically alerted the staff and fire department.  They immediately executed their emergency plan and everyone, including all 17 doggies who were there, was evacuated safely to neighboring CBW's.  All doggy parents were notified very quickly as to what happened and reassured about their doggies' well-being and location.  Although renovations were required due to smoke damage and extinguishment, this was a true testament to how well the CBW brand really watches out for our kids! 

To sum it up, this is just a great place with caring folks who really love doggies and the best way to keep our pooch safe and exercising when we can't be around!""" ;

The entry was clean and welcoming.  Murphy stayed for almost 7 hours and I watched him a number of times on the webcam.  He seemed to cling to staff but this was his first day at a doggy day care facility so it wasn't surprising.  I'm very pleased with their pricing and the packages make it even better.  I enjoyed picking up a worn out dog at the end of his day since he's normally pretty high energy.  They let me take a look at their cabins if we should ever need boarding as well and for my dog's size, his cabin would be spacious enough.  Murphy and I look forward to returning soon!

Edit: I did drop them a star as my dog now has kennel cough despite being vaccinated. This is the only place he could have picked it up. They check immunization records but someone must have brought a sick dog in the day my dog was there.""" ;

To explain, I found a coupon book in my mailbox this evening with one that included a deal for Centro. 

By the way, there was no special deal, as the website listed the same prices. 

Knowing nothing about this place, I turned to Yelp for some customer reviews as I normally do. The reviews were not awesome but they also were all based on experiences actually visiting the restaurant (slow service, that sort of thing). Given we were looking for delivery, I thought we should give this place a shot and order delivery. Bad idea.

As soon as I called, the person who answered responded "where do you live, we only deliver to Scarborough." Ok, fair enough (if the customer is seeking out a delivery option). 

I assumed that delivery would be fine, considering it's not that far and mostly because THEY delivered the flyer to my home (one could only assume if they delivered the flyer here, they would deliver to this area since they mentioned their delivery service). 

I explained that and she sounded annoyed. I apologized and she just hung up the phone. 

Bottom line, the worst customer service and as a comment to the people in charge of marketing this restaurant....make sure your flyers are actually delivered to the area you intend on delivering to.

Why tell me about delivery it you don't actually deliver to this area? Maybe the food is great but I will never know, nor will I visit based on my experience (also, the in-person reviews don't help)

Now I really have no idea what I would do without Maureen and staff. 
 
My dogs receive daily walks, and I also frequently use them for overnights.  Business trips can be stressful enough, so knowing your dogs are getting the best care while you are gone is priceless.  When you return and all they want to do is sleep because they played so much with their sitter - it only makes the next trip easier.   Scheduling for walks and trips could not be easier via email.  Maureen is organized and very responsive.
 
The staff truly cares for each dog as if it were their own.  I get frequent text messages about things my dogs did that day from the staff, joking about their personalities, and the dynamics between the two.  I feel they truly love my dogs and that makes all the difference!""" ;

Maureen and her team love your dog as much as you do- Perhaps the best example I have of this is when she carried our (then) 35 lb lab mix down 6 flights of stairs in the dark to take him on a walk when the power was out and the elevators were not working.

And it's fun when they feature your dog on their Instagram account. They truly treat our dog like she's part of the family. Highly recommend!" ;

- This place is owned by Compass Group:
Eurest Dining -  serves cafes, 
Chartwells - serves schools, universities, prisons
Au Bon Pain
Outtakes 
Morrison serves hospitals etc

ok ok.. enough of the history lesson.. (you may ask how/why do I know this.... WELP... you guessed it... I used to work at the Corporate Office near the old Arena off Tyvola)

anyway, with that said. This place is NOT NEW.. however the managment is EUREST DINING/COMPASS GROUP. The previous owner(s) was bought out. (Go figure). While the staff DID NOT CHANGE. The quality of food, types of food......AND PRICES HAS CHANGED. You can catch me here in the morning to get a good cup of Joe or a bite to eat for breakfast. Prices aren't THAT great, but... ahh it's not that BAD either. 

Salad Bar (by weight)
Cook to order section (i remember paying almost 7 bucks for 4 chicken tenders, SMALL fries..NO DRINK) 
Another Cook To Order section (pasta's etc)
And a Pre-Cooked tell-em what you want type deal. 

In the morning

No salad bar.... its replaced by Oatmeal, (cooked), Grits (Cooked of course), Cottage Cheese, Peanut Butter, Grapes, blah blah blah.. you get the point!
With enough seating for you, you, you're friend, your friends friends, co-workers, co-workers friends... you get the point on that too huh.. well, i think it may seat at least 150-200. 
3 levels of seating.. and a few spots out in front to cop a squat!

Go, enjoy...

ANYWAYS.  I've been here a couple of times, and your experience just depends on the day.  Breakfast isn't usually too busy, and they have a made-to-order station with most of your breakfast staples (omelets, pancakes, bacon, eggs, etc.).  I'm a particular fan of the made to order because you decide what goes in the stuff you are eating.  HOWEVER... close to 5 bucks seems a bit excessive for a 2 egg omelet with one protein and 3 veggies.

Lunch gives you a lot of options.  Made to order hamburger station (with the aforementioned sweet potato fries, holla), the hot lunch and MTO pasta (with daily specials), and a pretty good salad bar with good protein choices and different soups of the day (Au Bon Pain).

This is one of those places that you could eat here every day and probably never have the same thing, plenty of options to choose from.  It's cafeteria quality food from a cafeteria.  You are getting exactly what you expect  you should be getting.""" ;

My favorite is the VEGGIE BURGER, which is made of a unique combination of brown rice and veggies.  It's not your standard Boca or Gardenburger.  They have a good variety of buns and bread that are fresh and delicious.  The fries are great, and you can even get onion rings or grilled onions (or most anything else) added to your sandwich.  Recently they also started offering a PORTOBELLO MUSHROOM SANDWICH and a GRILLED MARGHERITA SANDWICH.  I love a place that offers multiple vegetarian options!   

The salad bar is also pretty good, but even my meatless salads end up fairly expensive (by the pound pricing).  

By far, the best value is their grill breakfast items.  Pancakes, waffles, any type of eggs or sandwiches... typically for somewhere between $2-$5.  A HUGE omelette with veggies and cheese never costs me more than $4.  I love it; it's a steal.  Plus, they execute well, especially if you tell the guys what particularities you have. 

Don't expect much ambience.  It's basically a cafeteria, but for a quick lunch, that suits me just fine.""" ;

Only downside and why I won't give them five stars, is because I'm currently standing in line for the grill (it is 8:50am) and there are nine people ahead of me.

Waren heute nach langer Zeit mal wieder im Come sempre essen. Nachdem es uns vor einigen Jahren bei unserem ersten Besuch nicht schmeckte, da die Pizza sehr fettig war und die Nudeln nicht gut zubereitet waren, wollten wir dem Restaurant eine neue Chance geben. Diese Chance wurde am heutigen Abend vertan. Eine bestellte Pfifferlingssuppe sah nicht nur sehr seltsam aus, sondern schmeckte sehr sauer und nicht nach Pfifferlingen. Die Bedienung best√§tigte unseren Eindruck und bot dann eine Alternative, eine Karotten-Ingwer Suppe, die sehr scharf war. Leider konnten uns die anderen Hauptg√§nge auch nicht √ºberzeugen. Ein Nudelgericht mit Calamari war so scharf, dass es den Geschmack der urspr√ºnglichen Zutaten √ºbert√ºntchte und einfach nur noch scharf schmeckte. Fazit leider entt√§uschend, trotz stolzer Preise.¬†

Die Bedienung ist aufmerksam, schnell und zuverl√§ssig.
Ich Esse dort meistens verschiedene Nudelgerichte da diese wirklich sehr gut zubereitet werden, fast noch besser als die Pizzen.

Die Karte ist insgesamt nicht √ºberladen und es finden sich neben den √ºblichen Nudelgerichten und Pizzen auch viele andere Interessante Gerichte darauf.
Geschmacklich wird hier nicht 0815 Essen angeboten, oft verleiht der Koch dem Gericht noch einen besonderen "kick" z.B. durch geschickten Einsatz von Kr√§utern.

Mit der Weinauswahl bin ich auch sehr zufrieden, allerdings bin ich da bei meiner Lieblingsorte h√§ngengeblieben kann also nicht viel √ºber die anderen sagen.

Das Preis&Leistungsverh√§ltnis ist sehr anst√§ndig besonders wenn man bei Nudeln und Pizza bleibt.

On that note, it's always worth checking the tide times before you do head across, as there would be nothing worse than having to call the coastguard out.  It is a fair walk across, along a path that is not of great quality, but this should be expected with the amount of time that it is probably submerged!

On a sunny day, this is a great place to go, and gives you a good view out into the Forth and across to Fife and beyond.  I have also been on a foggy day, when it is not as nice.  But then that's Scotland for you!  It's completely free to visit, and well worth the walk out in my opinion.""" ;

Apparently so do other people as last time I was there a massive pair of pink polka dot knickers was hanging from a hedge....

Aside from the campers shenanigans, which I'm sure are all too frequent when the sun goes down, Cramond Island is well worth a visit. Accessible from Cramond Village, which itself is worth a wander, the island is famed for it's 'low tide only' pathway. There's a handy sign nearby telling you when you can go, and more importantly when not to, and a bit of googling will be your friend if you're planning a day trip from your couch.

Walking around the island is a bit of fun, there's a bunker and some old walls that have been overgrown with weeds. The views are quite nice and there's boards that explain some of the history of the area.

So next time you're thinking of a trek up Arthurs Seat, maybe think of heading here instead, the walk is just as good and there's always the possibility you'll end up trapped! How exciting!

Sometimes it's nice to get close to a great body of water though. It always seem as though there should be a great impressive river between the royal mile and Princes street; instead there is a massive train track. This is not a terrible thing, but coming from a small seaside town, sometimes I miss water. Portabello and Cramond fill this void. 

I have yet to go to Portabello, though I have been to Cramond a couple of times, and it  is an incredibly attractive little village when the sun comes out. The island with the disappearing walk way offers a thrill. Don't get stuck there, read the tide times. There are no shops or amenities there, so you'd likely be hungry, lonely and cold for a couple of hours... 

The walkway provides a pretty walk, one can see the fife and several buildings along the bank. Once on the island, you can take a walk around, enjoy the quiet and tranquillity, hopefully avoid getting blown away by wind, and potentially see dolphins and porpoises if you wait patiently. Don't wait too patiently, or as already mentioned, you will get temporarily marooned.

I was a little apprehensive the first few minutes because the secretaries at the front were gossiping about the customers who called.. you know making fun of the way they talked or the background music they had playing. But I thought, it's fine because they seemed nice when I checked in and the lobby was clean. 
When I went back they gave me a price immediately on the mouth guard, $112- I loved that part! But then things started to go downhill..... 
After cleaning my teeth, the told me I had 6 "surface cavities" that would turn into root canals if not immediately taken care of. This shocked me considering my teeth didn't hurt and I brush my teeth and care for them DAILY. But again, gave them the benefit of the doubt. 
When I went to check out they told me my total for the fillings would be over $400... with my TEACHER STATE INSURANCE. And now my mouth guard was going to cost me $250. Absolutely ridiculous. 
So now my view has changed.. the secretaries are rude and obnoxious and they will do anything to penny pinch you and get all your money. 
I urge you to go just about ANYWHERE except this place. Horrible. I wish I could give negative stars.""" ;

Out of curiosity I took the pieces of chicken out and put them on my food scale at home and there was 2.3 oz of chicken for 9.99 + taxes, almost 12.00.  So I paid almost 12.00 for a bowl of rice and a container of sauce.  Having said that I will say the rice was good and the sauce tasted good, but not at 12.00, and 2.3 oz of chicken is not even half a chicken breast, a typical chicken breast weighs approx. 6 oz.  I doubt this place will survive long if they don't change their prices or offer a full serving of protein at the price.  For 12.00 a customer should be receiving a full chicken breast with sauce and rice.  This place is also trying to attract university students, not going to happen at these prices, students want value for their money and this is very over priced, tiny portions of food.  If they used dark meat chicken (which is what should be used in butter chicken) they be able to offer the meal at a cheaper price and the chicken wouldn't be dried out the was the breast meat does, plus customers would then hopefully be able to get a regular serving size.  Too bad, I was hoping they'd succeed here cause we need more affordable food options in the area for the office/business workers and for the university students, but at those prices and those small portions they can't possible get customers to come back.  I would go back if they changed their prices and the portion sizes, but at these rates, definitely will not go back." ;

The massage room was huge! There were two massage beds inside so you can bring a partner for a couples massage. Very clean and unique decor...The fireplace was gorgeous and they had a lot of plant decor as well. There was a citrus aroma from the diffuser which was very refreshing. 
The massage was awesome. I asked for a full body and the RMT (Trish) was actually very thorough. I felt like she found all my tight spots and managed to get to the exact area where it hurt. She ended with the best neck and scalp massage. It was my first time getting a scalp massage like this. Now I feel like I've been missing out. 
Its a small place but felt very personal. My appointment was for one hour but ended up spending an hour and a half there after my therapist gave me some pointers for self-massage for my back and I even spent an extra 5 minutes lying down after my massage was over. It was nice not to feel rushed. Overall it was a great experience.""" ;

There isn't much room for sitting either inside or outside, so my date & I took our ice-cream on a little stroll around town.

My 3 year old picks by color and they had lots of "colors", grape, orange, and smurf blue.  He ended up going with cake batter, which had all the colors he wanted in the sprinkles.  I'm a huge cake batter ice cream fan and I have to say this was one of the best ones I've had in a while!  

I chose turtle and strawberry cheesecake.  They were both super creamy.  The turtle had perfect swirls of caramel... but i do wish the cheesecake had more strawberry.  The waffles cone was crisp and tasty.

Prices are very reasonable and the homemade ice cream is very yummy! They make their own waffle cones as well, which definitely brings it up a notch in my book! It's 2.99 for single, 3.99 for a double, and 4.99 for a triple. Unfortunately, you can't mix two flavors in a single scoop, so you'll have to opt for the double in that case. It's a small store though so it can be difficult to maneuver the line. They stay open until 10 pm on Fridays in the summer, which is a major plus! I loved the cookies and cream and cake batter!" ;

The toppings (sprinkles, M&Ms, crumbled cookies, marshmallows, nuts, syrup)!!  And don't forget you can take home a pint, or quart of the flavors for binges at home." ;

            schema:reviewBody """Elizabeth Creamery is located behind Carpe Diem, in an area that is bustling and filled with restaurants to try.  My colleague and I were in the area eating and running errands and decided to make the quick walk over for some ice cream, given it was relatively warm outside.

The first thing I asked when I walked in was if they make their own ice cream.  I'm a fan of ice cream shops that actually make their own ice cream versus places that order in bulk ice cream from somewhere else.  Seems like Elizabeth Creamery makes their own ice cream - you can kind of tell just by looking at their ice cream and containers.

They allow you to sample up to 3 flavors.  I tried the grape (which tasted exactly as I thought it would) and the cake batter... eventually went with a single scoop on a regular cone (wish they had sugar cones) of the cake batter ice cream, which was pretty much like a birthday cake ice cream without the frosting swirls, but with plenty of sprinkles!  The ice cream was soft and smooth and tasted exactly like cake.  It was a bit more on the soft/melty side than I'm used to, but I'm glad it wasn't icy.  The cone was the basic kind of cone that had no flavor - wish I would have noticed that they also have waffle cones.

The service here was okay - the guy, which could have been the owner, was more reserved and not talkative whatsoever.  Maybe he didn't like the fact that I pointed out that there was a visible hair in their ginger ice cream.  Regardless, I would return!""" ;

The waffle was very fresh and the ice cream just hit the spot. I was a little disappointed by the actual scoop size, I expected a little more from the Yelp pics.

The shop is small and simple so expect to take your ice cream to go or grab a seat outside. This shop is locally owned by a couple, so sometimes the hours are a little odd. 

The owners are kind and the ice cream is homemade.The flavors are diverse, everything from your staples to ginger and mango  ice cream. The waffle cones are always fresh and the while the prices are a little more than you will pay other places, I'll gladly pay more for the quality.

This is a mom and pop shop, and I love supporting small local businesses! Maybe that's why the ice cream tastes so good? 

With pretty basic flavors, you'll want to come back for more if you are a Plain Jane or Plain James. You have three size options when it comes to the cups: small, medium and large and then a few options for cones: waffle or a sugar. The cone options don't stop there either!

            schema:reviewBody """Today I walked inside Elizabeth Creamery and got sucker-punched in the face with the notorious ice cream shop smell of vanilla, cream, and fresh waffle cones.

I immediately glanced over the different flavors. They ranged from the easy choices of cake batter, oreo, vanilla, chocolate, and orange sherbet. Then there were the others: bubble gum, mango, green tea, grape, praline, banana. The ginger-flavored ice cream caught my eye so I went for it. $2.99 for a generous single scoop was worth it. The ice cream itself was creamy with a superb mouthfeel. The ginger gently cuts through and balances the richness. 

I got to try the grape and the banana too. I appreciated the fact that they didn't taste like artificial grape or banana Laffy Taffy. Green tea ice cream was light and earthy. Elizabeth Creamery's waffle cones seemed to almost have the lightness and crispiness of a wafer, whereas other waffle cones tend to be a brittle, thinned-out sheet of sugar dough.

Samples are allowed but come on, everybody. It's ice cream. Live a little and take a risk. 

I quickly peered into the back of the shop. There were multiple ice cream machines and a lady ladling some batter into a waffle iron.

The shop is rather small. Limited seating indoors and bench outside. One restroom. Friendly staff.""" ;

The place is quick and quaint.  They take cash and card.  Due to the limited bar seating, be polite and move along after enjoying your tasty treat so as to make way for others when the line is long.

The only reason I didn't give these guys a full 5 stars is because I saw the man in the little back room making fresh waffle cones.  Sounds harmless, but the problem was that he kept eating bits of cone.  Still not a big deal, but when he took his hand straight from his mouth to a cone that he was rolling, I got a little skeeved.

(No, wait, did you know there is really a term for that? Brumotactillophobia- The fear of food touching.) *Not laughing. Not.*

Will keep this simple & sweet, like Elizabeth Creamery. Tiny cute place run by a pleasant yet reserved couple who make some of the best, creamiest homemade ice cream I've ever had. Fresh ginger is a staple in my home, so chose that flavor, and turtle. The ginger ice cream REALLY tasted fresh grated from the root. Turtle had sweet globs of caramel throughout. 

Because of the stark contrast of each flavor, was slightly concerned about them blending together as they melted on top of each other. No need. Had no idea side by side double-scoop cones even exist! Brilliant!

Born with an affliction-like fascination with the "how" of everything, I asked permission to photo the making of the waffle cones. A man immersed in his craft is a sacred thing, so I stood back in reverence.  They were tickled by my interest. 

May I try every single flavor before I croak.""" ;

The smell of the fresh made waffle cones filled the air inside the shop, which smelled delicious. I asked to try 2 flavors and wasn't a fan of either.

The husband and wife team behind the counter were extremely friendly, but there was slight language barrier when I asked for just one scoop instead of the standard two (not a big deal). My friend Sam enjoyed his entire cone and went for a visit a couple days later. I, however, had a slightly different experience with my ice cream. I will say that the ice cream is some of the creamiest I have ever tasted and did not make me feel bloated after eating it.

            schema:reviewBody """I never leave reviews. But I feel this is absolutely necessary. If I could leave no stars I would. Words can't describe how I'm feeling right now. I am devastated. Debbie gave us the worst customer service and butchered my dress. It's been a nightmare. We leave for my wedding in less than 48 hrs and we just got my dress today!!!!!! I don't have a dress for my wedding!!!! It's ruined! 

I went to Debbie because Glitter and Grit in Lawrenceville, recommended me to her so we trusted their referral. 
I reached out to Debbie in April, (wedding September) and told her what I needed, which was very simple, just replace bra cups, take in the skirt, along with add some light boning/ structure to the top. She promised me she could do all of this without the top looking or feeling different and it would be an easy fix. I also said I wanted to try to lose weight (I don't have a thyroid)  and so I asked when I should bring the dress in. She sent me an email saying to bring it August 7th, a month before our wedding, and she would have plenty of time to do the work. So I did just that. Plan was set in stone for the work and I felt confident. I went back as planned August 25th, for my scheduled pick up, first off she changed the appt time, and then made me wait 30 mins, I could literally hear her sewing in her basement. She told me she just needed to iron it, which was a lie.
She brought it out and it was not done. I was mortified! The top used to hug me, mold to my shape and was light and airy, she added a liner and made it bulky and the shape was all wrong, very unflattering and not what it looked like prior. You could also see the plastic boning through the material. My heart sank. She promised she would have the dress done by the following Thursday, and she was very rude to me like this was my fault , talked about how busy she was, didn't listen to my concerns, made excuses and sent me on my way. 
Last Thursday rolled around (the 31st) and she sent me a text cancelling my appt the morning of! Saying how it wasn't done yet. She then ignored all of my texts. So I had my fianc√© call her. She was so rude to him was literally screaming at him over the phone!!!!!! And wouldn't stop arguing with him! 
We caught her in so many lies and she did not follow through with what she said she would do, canceling and rescheduling and then blaming me!!!! She is literally crazy! And not making sense! She also said that the picture of the dress from the designer is photo shopped. Well... I have pics of me in the dress when I first bought it and they aren't photo shopped...Horrible customer service. Blaming me and not making any sense and she literally said "you don't appreciate perfection...." . Bottom line is my dress was not ready when she said it would be and she butchered it. On top of that her house has a very musty odor and my dress smells. I just can not believe this is happening days before our wedding. She also showed my fianc√© my dress when he asked her not to. She this out of spite.
I now need a new dress and I am out a lot of money because of this woman. Do not go to her!!! 

UPDATE*** 9/9/17 - I have 2 written and 3 verbal statements from employees/seamstresses from BHLDN, and an email from the designer, Catherine Deane, stating that the dress is ruined and it's non reversible. They were in shock when they seen what it looked like-( I took it to them in person while I shopped for a new dress all the way to Philadelphia because they don't have a BHLDN in Pittsburgh .) Not only does the dress look completely different, it's crooked, sloppy and just a mess. Their recommendation was to have Debbie pay for the dress (yeah right) and give it to someone for a Halloween costume. My wedding gown. Thanks, Debbie.""" ;

I had picked up 2 bridesmaids dresses from a different shop, when I tried them on they were both a disaster. Neither had cups, which I asked for, and one of the dresses hems was totally butchered.

One of the two weddings was Saturday, and I had picked up the dress Tuesday. A few of my friends recommended Debbie to me so I hurried and called her in a panic! She asked if I could come in Wednesday morning and I was so happy she made the time for me on such short notice! 

She sewed the cups into my one dress on the spot so I could leave with the dress. The other dress she completed in no time with a wonderful hem and fitting the top. She made them both look SO beautiful and fit me perfectly. 

On top of perfecting both dresses, Debbie was so sweet! I had so much fun going to her house and chatting away. She always got back to me and really helped me when I was feeling defeated about my dress for the wedding. AND her prices are AMAZING! My jaw dropped when she gave me the final total for each dress.

My only regret is that it took me this long to find Debbie! She is truly a rockstar!""" ;

            schema:reviewBody "I had a terrible experience with Debbie. While I cannot deny that she is an excellent seamstress, she  was extremely unprofessional and made my wedding experience very stressful. We both decided that the gown I wanted to wear for my reception was very low-quality and she was interested in making a new one for me.  She assured me that we would have plenty of time for the custom gown as it was a simple 1950s pattern. As the weeks went by she began canceling and rescheduling appointments. This occurred several times. Finally at the week before my wedding it was very clear that my dress would not be ready on time to be picked up as scheduled. I told her that I was very disappointed that we were in this situation and she became angry with me and accused me of not appreciating her or giving enough time. I contacted her three months before my wedding and if it was not enough time to produce a custom dress she should not have accepted the job. There were also other signs of unprofessionalism. When I pointed out that the darts on my dress were not the same length, she disagreed with me and would not admit that they were uneven until I asked her to measure them. When the dress wasn't laying right on my bust she said that it was because my bust was uneven and not because of the darts. When I asked her to add a ribbon to the dress, she agreed but did not mention anything about the price. Two days before my wedding she texted me to let me know that there would be an extra $150 charge for the added ribbon. At this point, two days before my wedding, she still had not finished my dress and it was missing the zipper, sleeves, and collar. At this point, I basically had no choice but to pay.  When we picked up the dress, she had not pressed it and simply threw the crinoline in the bottom of the garment bag instead of hanging it up. My friends had to buy a steamer and steam it for me the day of the wedding.  Her behavior was appalling and I would not recommend her." ;

            schema:reviewBody """I got married this past weekend and I would never have felt as good as I did if it weren't for Debbie. I got my dress from Glitter and Grit and when I received it, it was pretty but not everything I had hoped for originally. I ordered it with sleeves but they came unlined and it was also much more low cut than I had imagined. It needed some serious help to fit me like it should. Glitter and Grit recommended Debbie and I called her immediately. She asked me to send over some pictures and I texted them to her and she responded right away saying she could definitely help make this dress what I dreamed it would be. She does all of her work from her home, which is set up perfectly. Upon walking in her front door you immediately are in a room with tall, giant mirrors and large lights and comfortable couches to make the experience of getting fitted for your dress enjoyable. After meeting her and talking with her for just a few minutes, I knew right then that she was serious and super experienced. She was so confident that she could do all the things I wanted for my dress and I trusted her from the start. 

She ordered the exact same fabric that the rest of my dress was lined with so she could also line my sleeves to match. She also altered my dress to have the shoulders  fit my petite height and to make the neckline a bit higher like I had imagined. Every time I went for another fitting, I would bring either jewelry, purses, or shoes to try on with my dress to see if they would match and Debbie always gave me the time to do so and offered her opinions when I needed and asked for them. When I came in for my last fitting/pick up the week before my wedding, I walked in the front door and my dress was hanging displayed on the giant mirrors and it looked prettier than ever. For all the many things she did to alter the dress, no one would have ever been able to tell because the quality of her work was so flawless. 

Lastly, my dress had a beautiful train that really could not be bustled. I was so torn whether to try to keep it on for the whole night or to cut it off all together. Since my dress was made of tulle, it did not need to be hemmed or measured to be cut from the bottom. It occurred to me that maybe I could wear my dress with my pretty train to the ceremony and then cut it off for the reception. I presented this idea to Debbie, and she said she had never gone to a wedding to do that before but she would think about it. At my next fitting she said she would come to my wedding venue and we agreed on a price for this service. She showed up on Sunday after my ceremony and was waiting in my suite and promptly chopped off my train. It felt like a whole new dress when I went into my reception. What a life saver! I got the best of both worlds out of my beautiful dress. 

I would highly recommend Debbie. She is an excellent seamstress, very knowledgeable, and easy to work with even when wedding stress is so high!""" ;

            schema:reviewBody """TL;DR: I cannot recommend that you take your wedding dress to Debbie. She frequently cancelled appointments, was unresponsive to communications, and did not finish my dress in time for my wedding. 

THE FULL STORY: I took my convertible dress (a sheath and a separate tulle overskirt) to Debbie in early February, along with several printed pictures demonstrating the changes I wanted to make, which we discussed at length. She said she would finish some of the lace detail work in a couple of weeks, and we scheduled a second fitting for two weeks later. The night before the scheduled fitting she texted me to cancel and reschedule. My second fitting ended up happening towards the end of March, at which point she had not done the detail work she said would be done weeks prior, and the dress was in pieces. 

In the first week of April my now-husband and I decided to move up our wedding from September to June. I reached out to Debbie to let her know of the change and ask if the dress could be finished in time. She never responded, but I wasn't too worried because I already had a third fitting scheduled for the first week in May. The night before that fitting she texted me to cancel, suggesting the following Saturday. I agreed to Saturday and asked what time, but she did not respond. For the next six days I could not get a hold of her to confirm a time, until I finally called her from my work phone (a number she wouldn't recognize). When she answered and I told her who I was she did not sound happy that I had got a hold of her, but she did commit to a time for Saturday. 

At that third fitting she complained several times that she was having to work that Saturday (since she normally only works every other Saturday), even though she was the one who cancelled on me and suggested it as an alternative. Although I had provided her with many pictures of changes to the dress, she had forgotten about two of the major details (adding sleeves and fitting the skirt) until I asked when they would be done. Before we finished the fitting she asked me to take home the overskirt and work on it myself, adding that she would just charge me a lot of money if she were to do it. So even though I can barely sew I took home my overskirt while she kept the dress to continue working on it. 

We scheduled a fourth fitting for the first Saturday in June (and since she hadn't even pinned the hem yet, a fifth would have been necessary). That morning--two weeks before my wedding--she texted me to cancel the fitting and reschedule, suggesting the following Saturday or sometime during the week. I agreed to come in during the week, but did not get an immediate response from her. From my experience the last time she had cancelled on me, I suspected that I would not be able to get a hold of her to reschedule the fitting in time, so I realized I needed a backup dress. Although I had the overskirt in my possession, it had never been hemmed or fitted at the waist, and I still needed a dress to wear under it. So with less than two weeks before my wedding I started looking for another dress, and fortunately I found one, because I didn't hear from Debbie again until the day before my wedding.

I don't know if she just has a terrible system of communicating with her clients, or if she couldn't finish my dress and didn't want to say admit it. But if she didn't think she could finish the dress in time for the new wedding date, she should have told me in April when I first contacted her about the date change, or in May when she cancelled my third fitting, or even that first week of June when she cancelled my fourth fitting. I might have had time to find someone else to finish my alterations, and then wear the dress I'd spent a year picturing myself wearing on my wedding day. Instead I spent the last few days before my wedding frantically searching for an off-the-rack replacement dress, which is the last thing any bride should have to do right before her wedding.""" ;

Terrible experience at 2305 Lake Shore. The apartment and location is fine... but whoever does your showing makes it sound amazing, way better than it is. 

They talk about new features and fixes coming up soon that never actually come true (eg. More parking, security system on the doors, bike rack, walk ways, filling gigantic potholes). 

Landlords slow to respond and completely unorganized. The communication within their team is abysmal. You clear your schedule for appointments that they don't bother showing up to.  You gotta ask them over and over again for the same things. They're only really on top of things when they think you're doing something wrong. In that case most of the staff lack social skills make that a tolerable experience. 

The main dude talks smooth but basically just lies to make the buildings sound like they have no problems when really they're falling apart. 

There is a bad bug problem in the building. Lots of bugs and lots of COCKROACHES. 

Nasty place. Bad laundry machines. 

Save yourself the headache. Pay a little more rent and live somewhere less frustrating. The apartment Is falling apart, its walls are stuffed with insects, and your landlord really could care less about you.""" ;

If you work uptown, this is one joint where you can sit down to have a meal and be back at work within the hour, as long as you work within walkable distance from the restaurant. Gets busy during lunch, so I would suggest getting there a little early - has limited outside seating as well.

I, for one, love the Friday special - Cajun grilled fish with rice and beans. Can never clean the plate unless I starved the morning of.

Not quite the authentic French Quarter food, but still a decent place to have lunch at in uptown. Would have rated higher if food was more authentic instead of being ordinarily good.""" ;

I tried his food too and the flavoring was totally hitting it on every taste. The marinade on the London broil was outstanding, my salad dressing rocked, the Tzatziki sauce is absolutely the best I have ever tasted, it was so fresh and cucumbery, the feta was like goat cheese, real Greek olives, and even my peppercinni was uniquely the best, some kind of spice was on it, cucumbers nice chunks with no after burp. The cook even came out to ask if everything was to my liking as I had ordered off menu. The she crab soup, a delicious creamy dream, with a perfectly balanced delicate undertone of Cajun heat! I stumbled on this place by chance and will definitely make the drive into Charlotte deliberately for the French Quarter, as long as there's not a game, lol.

Service is prompt
Call in service is as expected

I onced ordered a buger, fries and drink... tab came to almost 10 bucks. I don't know if I would call that a bargin. (the burger was fine but NOT 10 dollars FINE)

During the summer months when its warmer (who am I kidding, its Charlotte, it may be 80 mid Dec) they have a few tables posted up outside where you can sit and eat, sit and eat and watch other patrons from several other food places walk past, or sit and eat and people watch or be watched... ekk ekkk ekkkkk!!!!

We were greeted immediately upon entering by a very nice and pleasant bartender who directed us to seat where we wanted. 

After being seated, our waitress came by to offer water for the table and take our order. Great start so far with service and hospitality.

We ordered 2 hamburgers one plain and the other with bacon cooked medium. Nothing worst than having a dry burger. I personally ordered the steak sandwich with a salad and Stella's for the table.

We weren't happy with the burgers coming out more well done than medium but they weren't horrible either just a burger. Our waitress mentioned the burgers are typically made medium unless otherwise requested. The steak was also ordered medium which came out more well done so it was a little chewy. Otherwise our meals were fine and the fries with the burgers were apparently a hit lol.

Overall, we will give this another try since our service was great and good wasn't horrible. I have to mention my steak sandwich was served without lettuce/tomatoes although the menu mentioned it. We also had to get our own napkins but again the service was actually good lol.""" ;

This was a disappointment to me as I would not mind waiting for some good French cuisine. I ordered the only traditional plate left on the menu, avoiding the burgers and fries... it was good but there are better places and better food. I don't know much about about French food so I was curious. The music was too loud an rappish (or R&B) so, although I dined alone, I would imagine it would be difficult to carry a conversation. The staff was friendly and service good but that is not enough to bring me back so I will not repeat." ;

The location is so so amazing so I hope they really step their game up. They are right across from the brand new park Uptown.  They advertise their dishes to be "comfort food with a touch of cajun" but that really doesnt come through at all.  It is simply a Greek restaurant called French Quarter.  

Having said that, they do have very good daily lunch specials and numerous local beers on tap up at the bar.  I have stopped in here a few times for a quick lunch while at work and ordered the chicken tips.  The best part was the gravy.  Everything else... so-so.

We also had an order of Greek fries, which are potato wedges seasoned with oregano. They were also good.  They weren't exceptional (like the chicken wings), but they were tasty and a good accompaniment to the wings. One member of our party ordered the nachos, which were average. I wouldn't recommend them.  

We sat outside on the patio, which was very pleasant. There are a bunch of bars/restaurants on this little strip and it's a bit secluded. So, it felt like we were in a small neighborhood, not in the middle of uptown.  I definitely recommend sitting on the patio if the weather permits. The inside seemed a bit dated and stuffy. 

Our waitress was very friendly and she knew the menu well (which I always appreciate). We went on a Wednesday, so the wine was half-off! The selection is limited, but I enjoyed the discount.  

I definitely recommend this place. The chicken wings alone are worth the trip.  The restaurant is also located across from the new baseball stadium for the Charlotte Knights. Stop by before or after a game!""" ;

Came down to visit the Latta Arcade/Brevard Court and while we were here, to grab a quick lunch on a beaufiful Saturday. After walking up and down the venue and reviewing a number of tempting menus, we decided on French Quarter.

The narrow confines of Brevard Court does remind you somewhat of the narrow streets and alley of the French Quarter but the comparison stops there. Nothing on the menu to suggest anything from Bourbon St.

Still a nice Greek/American menu with something for everyone.

Walked in and were seated immediately and were given our choice of where to sit. We picked a table by the window overlooking College Street with Romare Bearden Park immediately across the street. 

Both our host and server were great and efficient along with the young man I assume to be the manager.

From the menu I chose the Corned Beef Sandwich with Fries. The sandwich was excellent and one of the best I have had in a long time.

The French Quarter Salad is worth the trip itself. Large bowl lined with Pita's with and a mound of lettuce in the center and not just lettuce but a bounty of tomatoes, cucumbers, large fresh Croutons and an incredible amount of Chicken.

My wife always complains to salad that are just about all lettuce and maybe one sliver of tomato but not this time.

Fun spot to hand out. With construction and  Jazz festival at the Park, parking can be a bear but we ended up in the parking garage next door. 

Three of four blocks from Bank of American Stadium, one block from the BB&T Ball Park and within walking distance of a number of Arts Venues and Museums, this could serve as a good place to grab a bit when you visit downtown.""" ;

Went to the French Quarter for Dinner Friday before a concert.

Very pub-like - kind of has that neighborhood bar feel to it. Upon looking at the menu I wondered "What kind of restaurant IS French Quarter?" I wasn't sure what they were trying to be as they had pub fair, Greek, Mexican, Creole/Southern ...it was just an odd mix and right away that had me wondering.

Against my own better judgment I went for the salt and pepper wings. I decided on this for one reason only as that was dubbed their "famous" item. I figured if it could be famous it had to be great right? Let me first say I am a harsh critic of wings (having lived in Buffalo) - but salt & pepper wasn't exactly Buffalo style so I thought these could stand a chance. I was wrong. They were terrible! The wings were crispy but lacked flavor. ( the ranch paired with it was great though) - I decided to ask for some Buffalo sauce as I didn't want to be eating globs of ranch. I was really surprised with how great the  Buffalo wing sauce was! 
All in all I think I will branch out and try something else next time-but I wasn't disappointed..

Also, it was CHEAP - $15 dinner for two, really can't beat that.""" ;

We had to get up and go to the bar to give our order and had to do the same thing with our check when we wanted the change.  I've hung out here at the bar before and it was great but whatever you do, don't eat here. They only serve food gratuitously. It's not something they really care about. Quality is horrible.

I was a little disappointed at the menu options. This is mostly a salad, sandwich, and burger place. Our server was very attentive and friendly. The staff sat us right away as well and they were super nice too. Food was ok but I just got a club sandwich and fries. Friend for a burger and salad and said it was alright too. Would come here again if looking for somewhere fast and close, but I'm new to Charlotte and have so many other places to try!" ;

Pros. Other than the one problem with the soup the food is good. The Chicken on Pita and the Monte Cristo were both delicious.""" ;

We had 4 people in our group and we had a variety of burgers and sandwiches and everyone was very pleased with the quality and taste of the food.  Corned Beef Sandwich was excellent.  Only complaint in the whole meal is that the Burger Bun kinda sucked.  Crumbled and fell apart.  It was a great tasting burger too so it made me sad that the bun sucked.  I'd recommend this place.

I had high hopes for French Quarter, given my love of Uptown restaurants and my affinity for Cajun-inspired food, but I have to say both the food and the customer service was a major letdown.

Our server was not very attentive, forgot what we ordered, brought our food out without silverware and took several minutes to provide us with silverware so that we could actually eat, and failed to refill our drinks. The restaurant was also FREEZING... last Saturday was literally the nicest day of the year and they had the air on what had to be 65, totally unnecessary! 

Once we were finally able to eat our food, it was a) cold from us not getting silverware for a few minutes and the restaurant being crazy cold & b) not that great. The gumbo tasted like it came from a can and the mashed potatoes tasted like they were instant.

If the food and service wasn't enough to leave a bad impression, the restrooms were disgusting and there was no toilet paper. I will definitely not be returning to French Quarter... which is a shame because they're in a primo location!""" ;

            schema:reviewBody """Let's set the stage for my state of mind on my inaugural trip to French Quarter. 

Some combination of delirium from hunger (I hadn't eaten a solitary real food, unless wheatgrass and jerky are real foods)  and general anger from having to work an actual full day on a Friday compelled me to wings. 

I recalled a claim on the side of a wall at the latta arcade that this place had the city's best of those. Game on. 

French Quarter is one of those places that's description will change based on whom you ask about it. Some will call it a quaint little spot in the heart of the city. Others, a cool dive with a solid gimmick. Here's my take. I walked in and immediately felt like I'd walked into a "confederacy of dunces" era speakeasy (literary reference game over 9000). Very old New Orleans vibe. A little dark, despite the huge floor to ceiling windows and open door, but that's what happens when you enter a place with that much wood and stained glass. 

Let's talk service. There didn't seem to be a hostess or host to greet you at the door, and the bar was full, which is to be expected for a Friday happy hour. One of the wait staff - the little blonde one - saw this and made haste to seat me. The other one served me. 

I always take note of how long it takes to get your order in, and from there how long it takes the kitchen to hop to. they were especially on the ball. I only had to wait the exact amount of time it took me to peruse the menu and make selections to put in my order  

The food seemed to be out at the very moment the thought seed was planted in my head that I was waiting for my food.

It was out quick is what I'm saying. 

I have to mention the steak. It was puzzling. Don't get me wrong, I was satisfied with it, but I have to note that they add this steak sauce. You're either gonna love it or hate it. Me? The first bite was remarkable, full of flavors that my brain wasn't ready to experience. I made an audible exclamation. Every other bite was conflict. I know I didn't dislike the sauce, but I also felt like I could very quickly grow tired  of it. I kept taking bites, compelled to come to a decision.

Long story short, I finished the steak.

The wings. They came out mid steak. It was at this point I noticed the sun. He was on the wall, cutting his eyes at me. He had an American flag print on his face and color changing lights. I don't know why that caught my eye, but I appreciate art installations, so bonus points.

The wings. Alright, so the claim that these are the best wings in the city is heard to quantify. I got their famous salt and pepper wings. They have some really funky bleu cheese dressing. To me, that's a good thing, suggestive of the house made quality of all the food. I'll admit, the crispness, the size, the flavor despite their simplicity (not to mention how well they pair with that funky funky cheese sauce) make these some solid A to A- wings, but I'll need a bigger sample size before I can crown them. 

Definitely recommend if you're just looking for a nice place to share a couple drinks and eat some wings with friends.""" ;

She then brings out the fries and CHARGES me for her mistake. My wife had the chicken quesadillas. Not a great selection at all. Not a lot of flavor. Just cheese and chicken. When it was time for our bill, we alerted the server to the issue with the fries and she acted totally clueless.

            schema:reviewBody """I am not currently a frontpoint customer but I am in the marketplace for a system so I reached out to them to learn more and get a quote for our needs.  We have a large dog and he told me the pros and cons of the glass break option vs. motion sensors and how either could work.  He said their cut off for dogs was 40 pounds and my dog is 60 but I have always had motion sensors and they have never set them off previously so that was news to me.  He told me that some people will get the motion sensors but put them at the dogs head height and the point them up vs putting them near the ceiling pointing down and that can do the trick.  The downfall to the glass break only is that we have a doggy door- so if someone entered via that there wouldn't be any glass to break and with no motion detectors they wouldn't be detected. This is a big decision to make! 

We also talked about how they don't recommend senors on windows (I have never heard that before).  

Then we got into pricing and I asked about a camera (he did not suggest or offer anything that I didn't bring up).  We went through that and I was surprised that it was actually more than my previous home security company.  At the end of the conversation he offered discounts, one being a first time caller discount of $200 off of the equipment that was going to be about $500... that's a big discount- but I stated that I would need to talk to my husband first.  He explained that it is only for first time callers but that I had 30 days to talk to my husband as they have a money back guarantee.  For a company that on their site claims to be no pressure, that is the most high pressure trick in the book.  If I am calling to learn more, and explain that I am married and need to talk about the equipment options regarding my dogs and your size limits and camera, hammering in on a first time caller only option isn't the trick that is going to earn my business.  

Pros: 100% cellular equipment (the safest), upgrade features (if you specifically ask about them) and great customer service reputation

Cons: be ready to buy the first time you call if you want the best pricing.  Didn't ever even bring up home automation or energy opportunities I saw on the site, if I didn't bring up the camera feature he would have never told me the pricing.  

End of story:  The high pressure sale will never win with me.  Stand by your pricing and allow me the courtesy to make the best decision for my family- which includes reviewing it with my husband before signing a contract.""" ;

Due to the setup issues as directed on the phone with the company, I was warned by the local police if it went off again I would be fined.  Yikes.  I explained as of that time, that $42 a month for a security system that I'll get fined to use, that's not ok.  I got suckered in for that expensive monthly charged because I was just sent to Afghanistan, and needed something fast, and was under the impression that the monthly charge could be adjusted, well, you know what they say about fine print.  They will hold you to it, they don't care what extra fines you'll be forced to pay on your end for their system issues calling the police unexpectedly, and they will not offer in any way to make up for it or try to fix the situation.  After 3 years of hardly using the system, I found a WAYYYY better option that has so many more features, and the monthly charge of only $15 a month when you require communication with authorities, is completely no-contract and comes with 3 times as much stuff as Frontpoint comes with, and works so much nicer than Frontpoint's app.  6 entry points, 2 motion detectors, water freeze detectors, smoke, carbon monoxide detectors, multiple sirens, etc...  $15 no contract and way more features vs. $42 for 3 agonizing years and half of the stuff.  It costed me about $100 more for all that, but well worth it.  There were other great options out there too.  All I can say is ABSOLUTELY look around before falling into the fine print of Frontpoint.  Even after I gave the required 2 month's prior notice of termination of contract, they still charged me for 2 months and hopefully I'll see it back.  Oh, and if you don't read that fine print and terminate in writing before the end of the contract, you'll be bound by another year by their fine print.  READ THE FINE PRINT.  To me, if a company always points to the fine print in a contract whenever you have a problem, then they don't have a product that is worth it's value, they are simply making their money off of their fine print contact, not their great quality product." ;

Customer service is wonderful, and my favorite part is the smartphone app to let you set your system remotely (for those days when you leave the house and forget).  It's also great for "checking in" while you're gone to see that all the doors and windows are still closed.

I've recommended the system to several friends and wouldn't hesitate to keep doing so.""" ;

I thought $45 per month for just the absolute basics sounded a little high, especially after I purchased the crappy cheap equipment up front. When I didn't like that they wouldn't guarantee it would work with smart home devices like Nest Protect the salesman put me on hold for, came back and said it would work with anything that supports ZWave.

I received a letter three days later telling me I had to go get a permit before I could activate it. The form letter had forms for 26 different counties in my state, and I was supposed to find the right one, fill it out, and go pay for the permit.

It arrived, and I was impressed by how much it didn't have. Three door or window magnetic sensors, one motion sensor, and a low-tech keypad that doesn't even work with WiFi, much less ZWave.  Tech support confirmed it was all a lie, and it doesn't work with anything unless you order it from Frontpoint.  I sent it back the same day. 

If you need a very basic system this would be fine, but it's super-expensive compared to the other guys who do the install for you.""" ;

Scott the owner is a very honest and fair person.  He is an expert in his field with 30 some years' experience. He shares his experience and explains what is being done to repair the garage door.
I first contacted Garage Doors America back in 2009 because my garage door would not go up and down.  It was late in the afternoon and Scott came out immediately and repaired it.  He repaired the springs, cables, and center bearings plate.  To me knowing that my garage door was fixed it gave me the sense of security. I did not have to wait two or three days before anyone could come out.  
I once more in November 2015 had to contact for garage repair. Scott again was prompt and friendly. He is very knowledgeable in garage repairs.  Scott's commitment to giving quality service and satisfaction is what makes me certain that again my home is secure.  I highly recommended Garage Doors America for their customer service, integrity and all around awesome service.

I hired Go To Guys to complete a number of improvements at my house. The first couple of weeks they were very responsive and Joe got involved in the supervision of the work. At some point only his son Sebastian and an apprentice would come, often at random times. Sometimes they would not show up to work. When we were closer to completion I pointed out a number of issues with their workmanship and all three Joe, Carolyne and Sebastian cut communication. They did not answer my phone calls, texts nor emails. They had been paid promptly and whenever I had raised any concern on site they would always agree to fix the issue and assured to take care of it. Eventually they left with those issues unresolved and the work unfinished.

Just to name a few:
- The drywall work did not look professionally done. Dents, bubbles, uneven surfaces, awful shadows everywhere.
- Inaccurate framing. They framed the opening for a closet too small and ended cutting the hollow core door without my consent. They must have free handed it because the cut does not look straight. To make matters worse the bi-fold door does not stay in the track.
They framed another door, a pocket door, but the framing is not plumbed, it bows and the door hits when closing. They left without installing the door hardware.
- The casing was not properly installed, it looks wavy as opposed to flat with the jamb. The mitered corners do not match, there are gaps. They left without finishing all the trim work. 
- They did not replace a window that was within the scope of work. 

I even had more work for them (that would have been paid in addition to the initial estimate), but I was left with an unfinished project days before having to move in to my new place. It was very unprofessional.
I would not hire them again, not just for their lack of proficiency, but because a company that walks away from a job without response cannot be trusted.

I tried to call their contact number on  their website and it is missing a digit. 
How professional of them. 
I cancelled my order because their rude, ignorant driver William was going to be 2.5 hours late. 
His initial call I was accommodating to- said I'm sick and will be home so being that late with the delivery I would accept. 
He called a second time and gave me attitude about Costco not having half of my items ( how does Costco not have any sparkling water or Gatorade?). He kept repeating " do you want to cancel your order?" over and over as if to convince me to do so, which he eventually did convince me of the fifth time (instead of trying to come up with a solution.) He also said "you're not the only person this has happened to". Told him I'm the customer and stop being so rude. 
What a treat William is, they should be proud.  
Total attitude and seemed bitter he has to work on a Friday night, like it's my fault. 
This order was put in place because I am sick and wanted my items for dinner, between 6-7pm when it was supposed to be delivered. Again, his first call to me I was accommodating and said arriving at 8:30 pm was fine. The second call he just had total attitude. 
I'll be sure to tell everyone I know  to never use your service.

Update- after many e-mails back and forth with Instabuggy,  inquiring if our credit card has been charged / refunded, they still have not told me. Instead, I have received multiple e-mail replies from them stating: 
" We definitely did not expect for you to go and rant and rave on facebook, as well as give us a 1 start rating almost immediately, and prior to letting us make it right for you."
And
"We appreciate all your feedback, but really thought that you could give us a chance of getting back to you with rectifications before going ahead and posting (which is definitely something you are at liberty of doing)\"""" ;

 The food is tasty, but more like pub food than anything particularly fancy. Saying that i particularly enjoyed the haggis balls and fajitas.

 As the others mentioned - you choose 2 or 3 or 4 dishes - depending on how hungry you are. Some dishes are very filling like potato skins or the cheesy chips, while others are a bit lighter, scallops, prawn skewers.


 They bring the food as it is ready so it is always best to share - chances are that one person's selections will all come out first.


 It is a good place for kids - they can try lots of new things in small quantities. Also good for big groups - they have nice big round tables so you can chat to everyone.


 Wine list is ok - quite small and not very exciting but some decent enough reasonably priced wine.

They took extra care to ensureanything we had was not contaminated and ensured we knew which dishes were gluten-free and which were not. Even offered tomake up a special dessert for my husband. 

The food is always good. The coconut chicken and quesadillas stood out the most. But everything was good. 

Highly recommend, especially if you are gluten-free""" ;

For the extortionate price each dish costs, you really don't get much at all. The idea is that you get lots of things and share with your friends, and at roughly ¬£6 per dish you would be expecting more than maybe two pieces of falafel, or brie, or haggis etc. The portion sizes are tiny, and it's bloody expensive. It's the sort of place you leave and have to swing by the chippie on the way out despite spending roughly ¬£25 on 3 dishes and a glass of wine. The food isn't that great quality either, it's distinctly average and to be honest I wouldn't be surprised if the majority of it comes from the freezer section in Tesco. One to avoid, especially since the excellent Chop Chop is next door and they have an unlimited banquet for roughly the same price." ;

As Alice said, I think the principle of what is effectively international tapas is a great idea and, yes it was not the cheapest meal I've ever been for, but I had a really good meal and left feeling perfectly stuffed! There are a wide variety of different cuisines and the larger tables have lazy susan type things in them, making for easy sharing with groups. I tasted: haggis balls (very nice, I'd had something like this elsewhere and was really looking forward to trying them again!); meatballs - v.good and spicy; curly fries with bacon and cheese - normally I'm not a cheese on chips fan but these were really good; haggis, black pudding and a wee mushroom on a mini potato scone - not as good as the haggis balls actually but still tasty; wings of fire - these were ok, very spicy; I also ordered an indian-y thing that I cant really recall what it was called! Overall the food was excellent and I enjoyed being able to taste a variety of different things in the one meal.

The restaurant itself had a nice atmosphere inside, service was sometimes a bit slow but the waitress remarked herself that she hadn't been expecting it to be that busy on a Sunday night ('twas the night after the marathon).""" ;

 At International Starter the only dishes on the menu are....starters. They serve a variety of different starters from all over the world and these are split into continents on the menu to make it easier to find particular dishes. Unlike many restaurant they havent gone for the safe options here and we really struggled not to order everything!


 Between the 3 of us we ordered 6 dishes to share which was enough even though we all have hearty appetites. There are so many things that could be said about what we had but there were no complaints about any of the dishes.


 A highlight dish for me was the Jamaican Coconut Chicken while my parents preferred the Goan Chicken Bites. We also all enjoyed the polish dish they had on the menu and it was interesting because this isnt a type of food that is well catered for yet in Edinburgh.


 For those with more vary tastebuds they do more simpler dishes like nachos and they had several traditional Scottish dishes.

 The place was bitterly cold. When I complained the manager very sarcastically told me it was cold outside and we were in a very old building!


 The bread was stale and inedible.


 Having looked at Jacksons website that day, I knew exactly what I was going to eat and drink. Sadly none of what I had been looking forward to was available. When I questioned this the manager told me the website was four years out of date!


 My starter of duck confit was tough and tasteless.


 My main of rack of lamb was minute,over cooked and a third of which was pure fat. My wife's salmon 
was so dry and tasteless she couldn't eat it.


 My creme brulee was ice cold and certainly not fresh. The shortbread that came with it was so stale it would have been left by a hungry mouse! When I complained about the brulee the manager told me it was impossible to serve fresh creme brulee as it takes 45 minutes to prepare and the one served to me was probably two days old!


 We then ordered a tawny port from the desert menu. The manager told us they didn't stock tawny port. When I told him it was on the desert menu he argued it wasn't! Once I showed him the menu he then growled "well we're out of stock then"


 I expressed my bitter disappointment with the whole evening to the manager and he exclaimed "well what do you expect me to do about it?"!!!


 Jacksons ruined what should have been a wonderful celebration.


 We left disappointed,hungry,angry and over one hundred pounds out of pocket for what can only be described as the worst meal I have ever had!!!""" ;

For a theme pub, its gimmick is spot on. Massive black and burgandy leather booths, dark, dingy decor, big fake book cases, church pews, stained glass, "case studies" plastered all over the place, glass cases on the walls full of old botany equipment and Victorian gadgets....amazing.

I also can't believe how cheap the food is. 4 quid for main courses, are you shitting me? In this day and age! That is bloomin' marvellous!

I'm pretty sure a picture of Dracula is on the menus which is a bit of an identity crisis, but who am I to question a good Victorian icon? Put 'em all on there, I say! Throw Jane Eyre into the mix, she too was a bit frightful at times!

I had a bowl of chips and chilli out of here for 3 quid today. That ain't half bad.

The staff are pretty cool and the selection of booze is decent enough.

But the best bit of all, there are seats in the shape of organs.

Did you hear me?

So with a slightly gothy theme, this pub is surprisingly chilled out (although I've not been in on a Saturday evening), and I'm as happy to go here for a beer & burger with family as I am to crawl up to the bar and drunkenly order "a pitcher of LUST" with friends.

For those who know the term Jekyll and Hyde refers to a person with a split personality, but aren't sure why, I shall explain. The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde was a book written by Scottish author Robert Louis Stevenson, about a man called Dr. Jekyll, who had a good and evil side of his personality, but in a physical sense too, as his sinister scientific research had led him to drink potions, which transformed him into the evil Mr. Hyde.

It's fairly cheap as far as bars go, and the drinks are good. The Seven Deadly Sins cocktails are quite delicious, and there are test tube shots for the punters who aren't quite so concerned with sophistication. It's good old fun.

It sits on Hanover St next to The Dogs and over the road from 99, yet always seems to be busy(ish). It is decorated with skeletons, cobwebs and other sorts of leftover Halloween tat. The entrance to the loos is hidden behind a bookcase and whilst you're in the loos themselves 'spooky' noises can be heard. They play old B-movies in a wee cinema room on some nights and the speciality cocktails behind the bar are named after the seven deadly sins.

 I would never choose to drink here as I guess I just find it all a bit gimmicky, perhaps this place is best left to the students and tourists.""" ;

The drinks menu is decent. I quite like the 7 deadly sins and the range of other cocktails (Death anyone?). The bar staff are in complete chaos at times getting those fancy concoctions together but they do their job well and you're never left standing too long for a drink.

The crowd varies from hipsters to students to hard-core goths (I have seen a full PVC body suit complete with hood, it was amazing). This isn't a fancy George Street type place. Expect people to be beyond merry and still drinking.

The decor is the real pull of the pace. Think Dracula, think Frankenstein, think gothic and you've got it. Don't be fooled and keep heading towards the back if you can't find a table, there's plenty of room - including some awesome booths that look like converted confession boxes.

Perhaps the most entertaining part of the Jekyll and Hyde is the toilets: the entrance is hidden in a bookcase. Well, it's a wall that is covered in bookcase wallpaper but it's great watching people tentatively push against it hoping it will budge and praying that a member of the opposite sex doesn't emerge.

Music that progressively got heavier as the night wore on). Dark wood, the Seven Deadly Sins cocktails, a cavernous expansion of tables and booths to mull a pint over, and friendly, edgy bar staff. A perfect place or a post-Elite Event drink or three.

Around 30 yelpers descened on Jekyll & Hyde at 10pm on a Thursday night, and the bar staff weren't phased, served us our drinks aplenty, and there was more than enough room for all of us and the other punters.

The Seven Deadly Sins cocktails are quite fun, but not really connosieur cocktails if you know what I mean. I tried the green one (envy?) with cream, milk and mint. Basically like a mint milkshake, if you like that sort of thing. 

As Kerrin R has so eloquently put it, the toilets are somewhat of a mystery. Literally. They're hidden. Try and find them before you feel the need. I saw a few pained looks on people's faces who had returned, being unable, and had decided to try and avert the need. It's not gonna happen. But it's fun to find them when you're not in dire straits.

This bar plays off the gothic, melodrama theme well. It's fun, I can see it being somewhere I would happily hit up regularly for a drink or two despite not being the sort of bar that would serve me endless margaritas. I think it's a Scream pub (?) or a one of those chains but it doesn't really show. Great for groups, great for drink, great for some SOAD to Korn to full on shouty-shouty angry music (in hindsight maybe that's how the bar staff were trying to shunt us all out in the end?)""" ;

For those of you who haven't tried Innis & Gunn, it's REALLY potent and tastes so good you just fly through them. This was a problem at Jekyll and Hyde.

The night in question wasn't a busy one and there were plenty of staff on, but for some reason service was SLOOOW. Mega slow. I was waiting 5 - 10 minutes in a one-person-deep line. This was not cool, my pal and I were commiserating a dirty break-up and needed alcohol swift and constant, not slow and sporadic. So I started buying two drinks each per line-up, then eventually three each. I don't like to do this because I can't control myself; I drink quick and hard and get too drunk too early. Which is precisely what happened.  
After a few hours our table was COMPLETELY covered with empty bottles. Completely. When the glass dude came to clear them away he was all like "Are these all yours?" and we were like "(unintelligible sounds)". 

And then the guy was like "Impressive!"

In one passive action, I stopped caring that the service was slow, the tables sticky and the music not to my liking. We had impressed the staff at a heavy-drinking establishment with the amount we had drunk! Bar-cred for us!

If you don't mind your bars a little bit sticky and scrappy and with a 'who gives a fuck' attitude, give Jekyll and Hyde a whirl. Just make sure you know where the bathroom is before you need to break the seal.""" ;

It's a little off the beaten track being on Hanover Street, but not far enough that it's a hassle to get to.

Then there's the toilets.

They're behind a bookcase. If you know where they are, or look reeeeeal close, then it's no problem. Take a few people in after a few "adult beverages" and it becomes a war of attrition, watching people pushing blindly at the wall in desperation.

This amuses me, and I approve.

The bar itself is pretty good too, a nice selection of beers and ales - try the Trade Winds, it's groovy - and all sorts of shots, cocktails and shooters. The staff seem to genuinely enjoy working there and always have a smile and time to have a wee joke while they serve you.

During the fringe, there's always free comedy on as well, so check that out while you can.

It is themed around Jekyll and Hyde, and is a very dark, Gothic pub. Its very mad scientist in here and as you sit taking in your surroundings you will be transfixed by the random jars, test tubes and skeletons which  cover the walls. The music is a mix of rock and metal to compliment the surroundings. 

They serve a wide selection of well priced drinks, with special mention to the drinks named after the seven sins. I recommend giving them a go (maybe not all at once!), just to try them.

The food is pretty good pub food. It is fairly cheap! I had a rather tasty soup and sandwich for only a few pounds. The burgers are pretty good too. I'd say it is best to visit at lunchtime as it gets pretty busy with after work drinkers in the evening. We came on for dinner one night and the place was jam packed so we had to go elsewhere.

One last thing: good luck finding the toilets!""" ;

Part of the Eerie Pub Co. and in a similar vein as Frankenstein's, Jekyll and Hyde is a pub with an edge -  it's edgier than U2's guitarist. Taking ideas from the Addams Family and 'insert Tim Burton film here', the gothic themed d√©cor with its nooks and crannies and (fake) cobwebs and bubbling scientific experiments lends to a different drinking environment. 

The drinks themselves are amusing, in addition to the standard pints and wines and ciders, they have their own special potions. The Seven Deadly Sins are cocktails of varying strength, with my particular favourite being Sloth (think White Russian with a twist). To balance out the celestial battle of drinks there are the Seven Heavenly Virtues (ironically more deadly than the Sins) which are seven different shooters. There is a reward for anyone who manages to work their way through the menu.

The one irritant the first time you come here, but is highly amusing as a regular, is the location of the toilets. In true haunted house fashion, they are secret entrances in the bookshelves, a nightmare when you desperately need to go, and also it is difficult to work out the Cousin Itt's from the Morticia's leading to some amusing situations. 

Despite rumours that this place was going to be closed down to be a gastro pub (as if we need any more of those in central Edinburgh), it has stayed the course. So if you're around, Lurch on in.""" ;

There is, however, one reason to visit Jeckyll & Hyde. Go there later on, when people have had a few and watch them try and find the toilet.

I don't know whether to trust their prices anymore, because their prices are, for some, indicative of small portions only, but their menu doesn't say that at all. I believe my chicken biryani was around $6 and my butter chicken was $4. The chicken biryani had two pieces of chicken, but they weren't particularly tasty. Actually, the entire chicken biryani wasn't particularly exciting. It was surprisingly bland for a chicken biryani. I believe it was short grained rice, or it was just really crumbly rice. I don't know what Kerala food should be like, so I am not making any claims to expertise. The butter chicken was delicious. It was very flavorful. However, there were only four one inch cubes (or so) of chicken. For four dollars, I'd like more chicken, even if it does mean less sauce.

Kera Catering has their unique menu, and most of their items are not obtainable anywhere else in GTA...

Kerala cuisine has a multitude of both vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes prepared using fish, poultry and meat.  Rice and cassava (Tapioca) form the staple food of Kerala. All main dishes are made with them and served along with Kootan; the side dishes which may be made from vegetables, meat, fish or a mix of all of them. The main dish for lunch and dinner is boiled rice. The Kerala breakfast shows a rich variety; the main dishes for which are made from rice flour, or fresh or dried cassava. 

As with almost all Indian food, spices play an important part in Kerala cuisine. Owing to the weather and the availability of spices, the Kerala cuisine is richly spicy especially the hot ones -  cinnamon, cardamom, ginger, green and red peppers, cloves, garlic, cumin seeds, coriander, turmeric, and so on. Few fresh herbs are used, unlike in European cuisine, and mainly consist of the commonly used curry leaf, and the occasional use of fresh coriander and mint. While Tamarind and lime are used to make sauces sour in North Malabar areas; the Travancore region uses only kodampuli (Garcinia cambogia), as sour sauces are very popular in Kerala. Sweet and sour dishes are however, rare, but exceptions like the ripe mango version of the pulissery and tamarind-jaggery-ginger chutney known as puliinji or injipuliwhich is also known as Sou Ginger are popular.""" ;

Having moved to the ocean terminal area of leith about 5.5 years ago i had never even realised this part of town existed.  but once i knew, i was in love.  leith has been through a major revitalisation and the place is fun of trendy bars, cafes, and a few michelin starred restaurants.  there are also loads of new build flats mixed in with the older tenaments and a huge shopping centre with a 24 hour gym, spa, cinema, and a variety of shops.

but the leith area is far more than the shore and ocean terminal, there is the main artery of leith walk that runs through it and all the wee side streets coming off of that.  from these you can access a number of parks and cycle paths including the water of leith walkway which is a beautiful stroll on a sunny day.  there are also loads of places to eat including the famous la favourita with the wood fired pizzas (delicious!!), the lovely gaia specialising in sicilian food and good coffee, los cardos with its delicious tex mex goodness, and the sicilian bakery that i've told is the best place to buy baked goods in the city.  the place also has fantastic transport links as i can literally get anywhere in the city by hopping on a bus.

i feel like i could go on and on about my love for leith, but even having lived there for years there are still places i've yet to find and try!  just another reason to love the place even more, always something new to stumble upon.  so i think perhaps these lower reviews haven't been fairly given and maybe it's time to give leith's its due.  it's a part of edinburgh that's got loads to offer and is a fabulous place to live!""" ;

If you drive by Laird Dr, you cannot miss noticing this yellow bannered red lettered building that stands out from it's neighbour of houses and across from the Leaside Centre.

Overall, this place reminds me of Sunset Grill at least while I was there to have Breakfast and looking through the Menu.  Semi-open Kitchen of experienced(aged) short-order cooks that get food out at a good pace unlike my Sunset Grill experiences where I literally wait for the Sun to set.

Eggs Benedict w/Turkey Sausage & Coffee/Tea ($8.35) - Nicely done Poached Eggs with alright Hollandaise and unseasoned Home Fries.  What I learn here is Turkey Sausage is probably something for the Dogs over at Petsmart across the street.   2.5 *Star*

Western Omelette with Coffee/Tea ($8.95) - This was very FLUFFY, light and delicious made of fine chop Onion, Green Bell Pepper and Ham.  Simple item done right and quite fulfilling especially with Toast & Jam.

Note: Next time I'll have Coffee instead of Tea.  Pouring from Tea Pot, I got lots of wastage if not done to specified codes.""" ;

My breakfast special of 2 eggs over easy, brown toast, "home fries" and coffee was forgettable. Their version of a home fry is a large potato wedge deep fried like a jumbo french fry. It was well cooked and tasty, but isn't really what most people consider a home fry. Imagine that on a plate, devoid of spices (paprika, pepper) or onions with two fried eggs, and it paints a pretty bland picture.

A friend's eggs benny looked pretty good, and another was very happy with her grilled cheese sandwich, but their reviews weren't compelling enough for me to bump mine up a star.

I was dreaming of fish and chips, and there it was on the menu - halibut or haddock for $8-something for one piece of fish with fries and coleslaw.

The fish was fresh and perfectly cooked.  Portion sizes are ok for the price though I maybe should have ordered the two pieces of halibut instead of one.  The coleslaw was just right, made there I think, and there was a too-sour pickle to top it off.  When I asked for coffee, a pot of decaf was made fresh and it was good, in a bottomless cup!

Not in the mood for dessert so I can't comment on that.

The only fault I can find is Pet Peeve #4, which is FROZEN fries. Horrible things. No resemblance to actual potatoes.  Is it really that hard to peel a potato?  Still, because I enjoyed the rest of my meal so much, I will deduct only half a star, so please consider this a 4.5 star rating.

Atmosphere and decor was plain, which I expected of a family diner.  Since it was clean and not scary, we decided to stay and try it out.  

We were the only people in there, so service was very prompt.  Since my primary goal was breakfast food, I was a little disappointed by how small the breakfast section was on the menu.   

The food quality was comparable to Sunset Grill and Golden Griddle, but not as fancy as Cora's.  For the low prices, I thought the portions were generous.  The peameal bacon was moist and tender; french toast was crispy golden brown; the western omelette was flavourful; my only complaint was with the turkey club - mayonnaise came on the side but the sandwich itself tasted really dry.

Menu had good selection, but confusion amongst the eggs Benedict. It list different meats but doesn't tell you they come on the side.  Anywhere else I'd expect those to be on the Benny, not next to it. 

There was very little portion of what is clearly made-from-frozen home fries. Benny was ok but without anything between the egg and muffin.  I ordered the pork sausage so apparently it came on the side and was greasy and fatty. When nothing I put in my mouth feels right mixed with the others - something is wrong.

So I had to substitute my order, two people ordered after me and got there meals (same thing I ordered) before me. Ask to speak with the owner, and his daughters working the truck, had the  nerve to get an attitude with me! They need to be professionally trained in customer service. Poor service can kill a business fast, Spoke with owner, he didn't refund my money, only made excuses! Now an 8 minute order turned into 35 mins. Had to rush to eat and get back to work.
 The owner needs to refine his process for preparing to serve a lunch crowd: send correct menu to companies; arrive early, set up and prepare some popular dishes about 15 mins before lunch starts; contact companies to find out their lunch schedules and plan accordingly! One needs a business mind... in order to run a business, and a whim that is poorly developed and not well thought out! NEVER AGAIN WILL I WASTE MY TIME ON A PURCHASE!

I got the Crab Cake Dinner with Fries & Corn On The Cobb for $14. The sign however said $13, but they said because of Market Pricing of Crab that it went up. They should update their sign to all price changes. The Crab Cake was bigger than the bun and didn't have a lot of filler and most importantly DELICIOUS. The bun was toasted and soft. The Fries and Corn had Old Bay seasoning on them. The Fries were cooked perfectly crispy & the corn had just enough butter and salt.

There was a little confusion here with the order.  They did not take down names so you just had to wait around hoping no one claimed your order.  Also, I asked for a fork and they looked at me funny like there was some sort of fork shortage.

I didn't get there until shortly after 8, waited in line for over an hour.  Because the line was so long they were still serving customers after 9, there were still a good 25-30 people still in line.  I am finally the second customer from the window, it's 9:15p, and they tell us they're done!  And not politely either.  She just shouted to everyone \"WE'RE DONE!\" There were only maybe 10-12 people left in line!  So I didn't get to try anything!   I will never attempt to get anything from here again.

Me: Can I get a Kona Blend?

H: Non-Fat Milk? You got it.  Anything else?
M: Yeah, can I get a few sweeteners on the side?
H: Sure. Pink, Blue or Yellow? Hehehe...
M: Um, Yellow.
H: You got it, see you at the window.

As much as I liked the way she asked Pink, Blue, or Yellow, I can't help but feel a bit short changed here.  The total for a 20 oz coffee was $2.11... At Starbucks it is $1.83 methinks... Lets do a compare and contrast of the two.

In the end, there is a lot more they could do with the place to bring in more customers. Each time I come in the staff is sitting at one of the tables with their laptops out doing homework or watching movies. This leaves just three tables in the place to use.

This is the place where you want to have your brunch on a Sunday morning after a heavy drinking night or even just to get off the centre-core a bit.

If you are NOT the type of person who spends his paycheck on over priced restaurants to feel happy about his/her miserable life (we all know who those people are - right Mr. Ford?) than this is really the place for you.

I have been here multiple times and compared to other "hype" brunch places in T.O. this is my favourite: tasty and cheap (not going to get into specific details of what type of salt they use for their food and if their eggs are coming from friendly-happy chickens or not - I leave it to those other peps I have mentioned above. What you get is good food, friendly ambiance, and a low price tag.

Morning Glory looks like it's been crammed into someone's first floor house, and the kitchen happens to be at the back and it is tiny! This place is pretty cozy, and the service was decent, although we had to flag our waitress down a few times for refills.

The food is great, I got the special which was sausage & waffle with peaches. The sausage patty was the star, kind wish there was more of it, but it packed quite a punch in terms of flavour and it wasn't dry. The waffles felt a bit airy; but it wasn't bad. I was disappointed in the peaches though, because they looked like they were the Del Monte Canned peaches. 

Supposedly this place is the unofficially an extention of College's Aunties & Uncles, without the massive line. (You can see it on the article going downstairs where the washrooms are located) 

It is worth checking out, if you are in the area.""" ;

The pros were that it was early Sunday morning (around 9:30 a.m.) and there was no wait or line to get in. It was also relatively close to where we were staying in Regent Park so it was walking distance. The second pro was that we had six people and could be seated right away. The place is very small so we had to push three tables together to make it work. We were given water and our server did take our drink order almost immediately after being seated, so that was good. However, after she delivered our drinks, she disappeared and we had someone else wait on us the remainder of our visit.

The cons were mostly the food and price. While the food was OK, it wasn't anything amazing and was also pretty expensive for what you got. Someone in our party ordered the breakfast burrito which sounded heart and big, but was actually quite small, didn't come with a side and was almost $8. I ordered the granola and yogurt bowl which was around $8-9, didn't come with the maple syrup it said it would come with, and I couldn't tell our server because she disappeared. The fruit was simply apples and blueberries, so nothing super delicious or revolutionary or even seasonal. Also, I ordered a side of scrambled eggs and it was $3! FOR EGGS. 

Our final bill, with six of us was $91. That is almost outrageous for a mom'n'pop diner-type restaurant for breakfast if you ask me. Nono of us left very full or happy and I can guarantee we won't be back.""" ;

While the sandwich was decadent (three quality melted cheeses AND tomatoes, plus the light rye bread was crispy and sufficiently greased up), I had to subtract a star for the pitiful rosti. Though it tasted just like rosti should (perhaps the addition of paprika would spice it up, just sayin') the portion was pathetic - just a few shreds of potato that barely stuck together and definitely not $2 worth.

The fact that the kitchen is itty-bitty and that there is only one cook limits how quickly it takes to get your food. The poor circulation here will also ensure that you smell like grease by the time you leave!

The goat cheese and arugula omelet was delish and the rosti reminded me of Richtree's. I took a chance and ordered the pan bagna - tomato, red onion, olives, cheese, sun-dried tomato and greens on a ciabatta ($6.50) - which turned out to be an amazingly good surprise.

Nothing special on the menu - I could have made the meal at home and been just as happy.
Eggs were cooked well, toast was toast.  Potato rosti just fell apart as I tried to eat it.  Coffee was ok, thought I had accidentally ordered a milkshake when I saw the size of it, but wasn't too bad.

Since I'm from out of town, I look for anything non-touristy so I was pleased when I noticed folks from the neighborhood stopping in to grab their regular breakfast. 

Important to note, esp if you're not from Canada.  They only except cash.  

Don't go to Morning Glory if you're looking to run in and out for a quick bite.  It's more of a "lazy Sunday morning, let me read the paper with my 2nd cup of coffee" type of vibe.

I was going to Buskerfest and wanted to find a brunch place in the St. Lawrence/Corktown/Financial District. I narrowed it down to Morning Glory (thanks Kat F!) and Le Petit Dejuner. It was only 10:45, but when I passed LPD, there was already a line-up. Morning Glory, it was!

I ordered a latte (delish!), the omelette of the day (homemade salsa and cheddar) and a 1/2 order of french toast, as is my normal M.O. The salsa was amazing -- fresh and so delicious -- which made the omelette outstanding. The french toast was good, but was cold by the time I got to it (see below).

They were full inside without a wait, but had seating on the lovely, and tiny, back patio. Unfortunately, their beautiful flowers, and delicious food, attracted the swarms of bees inhabiting T.O. this summer. Not to be thwarted, I perservered. For about ten minutes, until two bees landed in my french toast, at which point I went inside. My server was really sweet about it and let me know when there was a table available inside, so I was able to finish my eggs and eat my french toast.

The staff was super friendly, the menu was selective but seemed to have a variety, and was very good. I would like to go back for lunch and try a sandwich, as they looked fab, too.

They have a little blog on their website that updates the specials each day, although it hasn't been updated since May 2009.  Still, it's a great idea.  I definitely recommend Morning Glory.""" ;

What I didn't like was how small it is inside and how many tables they jam in there. When it's half full it feels like there are too many people and when it's full I feel claustrophobic, which is strange because I'm not bothered by small enclosed spaces normally.

It's a small, bright space that feels very welcoming and seems to attract both in and out of neighbourhood clientele.I've enjoyed several of the omelette specials and many menu items, all scrumptious. Service is pleasant and very helpful in working through special requests or allergies with patrons. 

Definitely try out that incredible homemade ketchup! you will not believe that the stuff that comes out of the squeezy bottle is supposed to be the same thing.

            schema:reviewBody """In the tradition of this weekend, I liked the food here and pretty much have a lot of negative things to say about the service.

The good:
- it's not that busy but it's still busy enough
- the food is good; Laura LOVED her special omelette with sweet potatoes and goat cheese. I liked the hashbrowns and the meats are from Rowe farms.
- the homemade ketchup is GREAT. It's spicy and sweet.
- the coffee is fine.
- it's cheap. Two breakfasts for 22$.

The bad:
- there is only one cook and the food takes forever.  This in turn leads to long ass wait times for table turnover.
- they don't have a system for having people wait. We waited outside for forever for a table and they finally sat us in the worst seat in the place next to the kitchen and the cash register. There were two free tables when we sat down and people who arrived after us were seated at a much better table. This was the epitome of annoying to me and the staff seems like they don't know that this was wrong.
- I generally thought the staff was pretty terrible.

Funny story:
There was a woman who accosted Laura M at the parking meter and shouted a crazy rant at her.  It was pretty offensive so I'll leave it out of the review but pm me for details :) it was kinda hilarious and I am not sure if she was a real nutter or if this was performance art.  It involved a lot of fist pumping and a (possibly) fake English accent.

Would I go here again?
I wouldn't make a habit out of it but I really liked their ketchup. I might try to make that ketchup at home and if I succeed then I would have no reason to ever come here again.""" ;

It is a small yet cozy cafe that can get filled up pretty quick at peak times. The staff are very friendly and helpful. My favourite is the 2 (overeasy) eggs, multi grain toast with potato rosti ($5.50) with a side of fresh jam. The eggs are always done to perfection. Also, when I am more in the mood for a healthy lunch dish I go with the Pan Bagna: Fresh greens, with a light drizzle of vinagrette, sundried tomatoes, black olives, vine ripe tomato, red onion and piave cheese served open faced on warm crusted ciabatta ($6.00). My only wish is that I lived next door so I could breakfast there more frequently.

Consistently good brunch, with nice selection of menu items: brunch items (omelette), sweet/savoury (french toast, waffles), and breakfast sandwhiches.  Any of their sandwhiches with grilled ham or melted cheese are really good.  Morning Glory also uses Ace Bakery bread.  They have seasonal specials too.  

The restaurant is very quaint, seats maybe 30 people at most.  There is an old-fashioned charm: coffee served in old Corelle mugs that keep the coffee warm.  The kitchen is tiny and very busy, since most of the time the place is packed.

Service is friendly, efficient, and waitresses come around to top up coffee on frequent basis.

Good prices with free street parking on Sundays.  Brunch for 2 with coffee and latte was $25 with tax and tip.""" ;

Second: They brought juice in a glass that had such a big chip on the top, that we had to be careful to avoid putting that aide in our mouth - sharp glass edges and all.

Third: My partner ordered his eggs scrambled, but they came whole and well cooked. We didn't complain, because anyway they were taking ages to notice us or for anyone or come by.

Fourth: I ordered their special omlette of the day (mediterranean) and it had such a strong after taste of some cajun-like spices that I couldn't eat it. Pity because I usually relish my eggs, and have never had them so funnily flavoured.

Fifth: We kept signalling for ages for the bill, but the servers were busy chatting behind the counter and didn't notice. Two servers in a small place like this shouldn't be so slow.

Atmosphere: like I said, place is super cute and small. We unfortunately sat near the door and it was freezing for all of us who had to sit closest to the door when it opened and closed. For some reason the door doesn't fully shut so the server was trying to help us out by keeping the door closed with the newspaper stand. Good effort but it wouldn't close!

Service: Service was good. The place is small so you don't need that many people. There is about 3 that work there. One that serves and 2 who are in the kitchen. It's nice that the kitchen is in the back so you can see the chef cooking away but I kind of leave the restaurant smelling like food! The ladies came by a few times to top up my coffee. Coffee is key so I liked that! I know some reviews mentioned the food took long. I felt the same but kept in mind that there is only one cook in a tiny kitchen in the back. 

Food: everyone enjoyed their food. My friend had their omelette of the day: arugula pesto goat cheese and she said it was good. The others had the Jimmy Screech which is a havarti and ham sandwich with a mixed green salad. They all enjoyed the food. I had the typical breakfast. 2 eggs, rosti (which I absolutely love) and toast. I added a side order of bacon and it came with 5 slices!

Came on a Saturday around 12:30 and there were lots of tables. Note that there is no A/C and it's open kitchen so it gets warm... but smells great. 

They have a nice selection of teas, but I was already so hot so I went for a large glass of freshly-squeezed OJ which hit the spot. The specials are on the blackboard and there is a small menu of well-priced sandwiches and egg dishes (most $6.50-8). I had the omelette, which had goat cheese and freshly grown ___ (some green vegetable that I had never heard of before). It was flavourful and light; I think they use 2 eggs, the portion is not huge. It came with some whole grain toast and a small side of rosti where the potato is very finely shredded. Yum! Best part - the homemade ketchup. It's a must-try if you ever come here. My DC had the waffles with sausage and mangoes. Interesting combo. Looked great though.

- my bacon was served super undercooked so I asked to get it re-cooked until crispy. It arrived about 10 minutes later (i was finished my meal at this point) and it didn't look any different than the first time it was served to me. I couldn't eat it.
- there was no jam or anything to put on my toast, so left that on my plate as well.
- even when it was obvious I did not like my meal (toast and bacon left on the plate), the server did not say anything.

2) Technicians were very nice and chatty. Willing to give suggestions and are patient when you choose your colour! they also let you put on a little swatch of a colour to see how it looks on. I also didn't end up like my toe colour when it was applied to one foot so she happily helped me pick out another colour.

3) Complimentary beverage included!

4) Of course the price was right because it was a Travelzoo deal. I'm not a big fan of pedicures and this salon is a bit far from my house but the prices are about on par with other nail salons for sure. You can also book appointments online which is great.

Overall it's a cute place that's not your run of the mill, in-and-out, no chatting nail salon. A nice difference.""" ;

The booking was smooth and easily completed on-line.  The place is really cute, warm and has a great vibe.  I found the staff very nice, friendly and chatty (maybe a bit too chatty).  Anyhow, the shellac colours were a bit limited for me (and all I really wanted was a pale pink with no shimmer), but I found a great blue for my toes and got a really  nice pedicure.  It was a very basic pedicure, no soak and a VERY quick treatment of the dry skin on my feet and super fast massage.  Moving on to the manicure was a whole other story.  My nails were cut  way too short (they are actually hurting as I type this), and 8 out of my 10 cuticle were bleeding.  I was in so much pain as my technician continued to douse my hands in the blue anti-septic liquid they use.  I actually had to get a kleenex on my way out the door, as my fingers were all bleeding.  Ironically, there seemed to be many regulars in the salon at the time who were very happy.  I was told they have a large regular clientelle, and rarely have time for walk-ins.  My thoughts are that they give the least experienced, most junior staff to the coupon holders.  It is real shame, as I would have definitely come back, based on the vibe and friendliness.  Unfortunately, now I am more worried about safety and health concerns because the job was done so poorly. Bottom line, you get what you pay for.  If you aren't prepared to offer the same level of service and care to all of your customers, then don't offer coupons.  I would not recommend this place.

UPDATE: over a week later, and two of my cuticles are now infected and three others are just scabbing over and starting to heal.  I have NEVER had this experience in my life, I would NEVER recommend this place!  Downgrading to 1 star, and that's only because the place is nice, and sadly I'm convinced if I had a better technician things would be very different.""" ;

Walked by on lunch today during their business hours, thinking I would pop in and make appointment in person. CLOSED. During their posted open hours.

I had an appointment at 1. I reached a couple mins after. There were two people working there and was asked to wait I didn't mind. There is a funny smell in the store but didn't seem to linger too long. They have a wall with stuff they sell and their promotions and what not. To sum up their look...vintage.

So I bought the deal that they had going on and decided to try out shellac. Walking down on mt pleasant I was surprised to see how many spas there were. It's insane!!

My actual experience was great! I actually really enjoyed it! (mind you I have an easier time talking to a random rather than a stranger I'm spending time with) After a while Alex(the one helping me) and I started talking and it was very real and she was great!

Since I'm not so much into getting nails done I don't know when I will find myself going back but if I was I would definitely find myself making my next appointment!

Also I LOVE shellac :)""" ;

When I first walked in I noticed a display of handbags for sale as well as some Jewish music CD's which I thought seemed kind of out of place for a nail spa, but whatever. When I sat down I was offered a cup of tea which was served with a little cookie. The red colored champagne came later.

Instead of the big leather massaging chairs you'd find at a regular nail salon, this place had what looked like IKEA chairs fitted in striped slipcovers. The staff would bring a steel bowl filled with water for the foot soak. This was not included with the promotion, as I was told soaking will cause lifting of the polish. 

All that was really done during the mani and pedi was cutting of the nails, a light buff and the polish application as well as applying your choice of homemade scented moisturizer. The staff was pretty friendly, but seemed to take a very long time working on my nails considering the fact that many typical steps were left out. 

Overall, for the price I paid, the experience was ok, minus the fact that the polish on my thumb chipped two days later. For the regular price, I would not return here.""" ;

The porta potties were too close to the trucks, they stank, and they were dark.  The water ran out from the hand washing station, thank goodness I stay stocked on disinfecting hand wet wipes. To top it off, the door failed and who knows how many people caught a peak at me hovering when someone opened the door to the one I was in. Yeah, I have a new embarrassing story to try and forget now...  But today, I can't forget because someones food isn't agreeing with us, and we have to stay close to our own clean, well lit bathrooms.   

I had the goal to at least try to get a $65 meal worth of food for us, because that is what the tickets cost, but it didn't happen.  We ended up at Jersey Mikes after wards, just to get some food on our bellies.   

The good part, the ice cream from utterly delicious was soooooooooo good.  The sweet Caroline from epic hot dogs was very good. The hush puppy from the New Orleans style truck was very good.  The BBQ and coleslaw from the Piggy truck was very good.  The pork nachos were good, the cheese was sooooo good (this was the pink truck with a pretty blond on the front).  The creme brulee was yummy, no fancy steakhouse version, but still enjoyable.  

The frybread truck (on the far east side of the lot) wasn't good at all, the bread was doughy and had no flavor.  The lumpia from Hey Joe wasn't good either.""" ;

At one point I was hungry and just wanted to buy food from the truck we liked the best. When we passed through the 15 minute line I asked if we could put in a order and pay for it. I was told samples only.... totally lame that I would have to wait and wait and wait just to feel full.

I found a little pink BBQ truck with cinnamon infused sauce on their meat and a very small line and hit them up a good 5 times over the night to try and get my food value out of the night.

The two hotdog trucks both did a very good job on both keeping food coming out to the people, and customizing to keep everyone happy.

The dirt atmosphere was harsh at times for this reason... you would be in line eating some tots and then be hit with a breeze of dirt.

No Tots and dirt please

Many trucks ran out of food early which seems to be unfair to both paying customers and other trucks in the area still cranking

If this becomes the norm, the good trucks will bring less food so everyone can relax after a certain hour, and the customers will miss out.

The live music was fresh, but sometimes they were playing over other music on speaker, weaksauce.

they need to have a bigger location because the lines were out of control and half the battle would be finding the right line for truck.


I almost gave it 3 stars because I did have some good food and at 10 when we left we defiantly had our money worth. Twas a decent date night because were more on the relaxed side, but I could defiantly see many frustrated people just give up after complaining the whole time. 

Lets hope they make some key changes for the next one...""" ;

I was smart and arrived BEFORE 4:00 P.M. so I could jump in early for some short and FAST lines.  My 15-yr-old son was with me, and he's a fairly picky eater, which was one reason I brought him - so he could see that there are other foods he might like if he TRIED them.

I got a lot of food between 4:00 and 4:30, when the lines were short.  I probably got to try 10 trucks before we left at 5:07.  We went back to some trucks more than twice or three times when we found something we liked.

My advice for future events:

1.  Help the trucks deliver the samples FASTER.  Not sure how - maybe get them an extra staff member?  But the samples on some trucks were coming SLOWLY, so that needs to improve.

2.  Better location, maybe not on dirt, and maybe a little larger.  Once the lines got up to 20-30 people, the going was CRAMPED and it was taking a long time to get your samples.

3.  Maybe a lower price for tickets?  Seemed kinda steep for the amount of food each person received.

All in all, I enjoyed the FOOD, but the rest of the logistics, not so much.""" ;

Luckily, Montana BBQ for a $15 plate, was tasty and I put extra BBQ on my plate so we also put it on the Fry Bread too.  1 person was designated for each Beverage station so even getting a drink was soooo slow.  I heard 12 food trucks ran out of food by the time, I even received just 2 dishes.  Luckily we stood in separate lines.

The Food Truck Festival welcomed us with a hot dirt lot filled with thousands of people standing in zig-zaggy Disney Land-esque lines with maybe 20 - 25 food trucks.  The promotions for this event stated "over 30" trucks would be there, but I guess that doesn't matter since you wouldn't be able to try all of them anyhow.  Each line was 50+ people deep and took 20 - 30 minutes of standing in one to get a bite size sample. 

You had to stand in THREE lines to get a beer. One for ID check. One for wristband. One for beer. 

For some reason, children were admitted for free - this created a mess of strollers trying to push through lines and unattended children running around, bumping in to people. 

The Mister and I were here for 2 hours and tried itty bitty samples from four trucks.  I was so disappointed and frustrated in this event that I asked for a refund.  I was presently surprised that that process was very painless, basically no questions asked. The staff and cooks were all very friendly and did a great job, even though they were all in way over their heads. 

I understand that this is their first time putting on this event and they will sure have plenty to learn for the following years. I want to support this, and if I hear about changes being made I will certainly try it again next year.""" ;

I got there at 2:30 and the lines were ALL incredibly long.  So we chose one and just stuck with it.  An hour and a half later we got a sandwich.  It was good, but they ran out of stuff as we were waiting so we ended up with something different than we wanted.  
There were a lot of BBQ trucks that might've had smaller sample sized items but most of the trucks were just full meals, so I didn't get to sample different types of food.
The reason it took so horribly long seemed to be that the organizers oversold the event.  I heard that there was supposed to be maybe 5,000 people and they sold 15,000 tickets.  Food trucks can't move that fast and there were only between 20 and 30 of them.  Mistake.

Bricks were on ground that people could trip on. (not too far from short leash dogs) this area was SARDINE SQUISH CITY.

Then I was just hanging out with some friends for 30 minutes or so and all of the sudden it was crazy busy. Lines were long. No, it didn't help that people brought a bunch of children and strollers. No, it didn't help that so many people were allowed to buy tickets BUT this only lasted about an hour and a half and there were in and out privileges so why not leave and come back? We ended up just hanging out and enjoying each other's company...which is a fine thing to do! This is a festival.... not a fast food drive through. I waited in maybe 3-4 very long lines, but they moved fast enough and it helped me portion control. So as the night went on, the place seriously cleared out. I was able to get samples from almost all of the trucks without waiting in too many very long lines. ALSO, it was awesome cuz towards the end of the night, both Short Leash and SuperFarm had late night specials! Fried banana with nutella... yes please! So I think that it could have had better planning or a bigger space, but really, it is the first festival, and it wasn't as bad as everyone is saying, plus, this is AZ, I wasn't so horrified by it being in a dirt field.... a grassy park would have been destroyed in a festival like this and I didn't find that dust got in the food cuz each sample was like one bite...maybe that's just me....it's a learning experience, and I'm sure next years will be even better!" ;

We wanted to go when the sun was not shining because my husband is a redhead and we wanted it to be cooler.  But we got stuck during the rush.  And while we did get some good food while we were there, it wasn't worth the ticket price (but if the beer we drank was free, then it could have worked).  Some trucks were prepared, others weren't.  I'm not really surprised the the trucks that have been around longest were the ones that lasted at the festival (short leash comes to mind).

I was kind of disappointed that some of the trucks were handing out samples that aren't even variations of what they regularly serve.  That bugged me. 

The fry bread truck right near the entrance was fantastic and had a long line to prove it.  They totally could have used an extra hand and maybe not have given people so many options.  Just hand them the food and make them move on.  That being said, the pork and green chile was soo good.

I look forward to seeing improvements on the next one.  I just hope they don't decide to charge more than they did this year.  It needs to be amazing to charge lots of money (I hear the festival in LA is like $75 to get in).

I was expecting that Roosevelt was going to be blocked off for this event, and all the food trucks would be parked on the street, with plenty of room for people to mill about.  WRONG!  Instead, they had all the trucks parked in a small dirt area off of Roosevelt, which made you feel (1) dirty, (2) cramped and (3) hungry!  The chaos was completely overwhelming, and most of the food that I was actually able to try was underwhelming.  Not a good combination.  As another reviewer noted, I felt like I was at Disney World during Labor Day weekend because the lines were ridiculously long -- some to the point that they curved around twice!  We started off at the Cajun food line which was moving quickly because they (smartly) had someone handing out food to people in line, and then we quickly hopped on the line for the BBQ truck while still eating our Cajun food.  Then after getting the BBQ food we quickly hopped in line at the Hey Joe Filipino truck.  It took about 20 minutes to get through each line.  We were really annoyed and frustrated, so then we just grabbed some shaved ice and a smoothie from another truck (can't remember the name) and left.  We ended up at Windsor for food and drinks.  It's a shame that we paid $30 each for entry into the Food Truck Festival, and maybe had $5 worth of food.  What a ripoff!  We should've asked for a refund like another reviewer.  Unless I hear that some big changes are being made for next year, they won't get my $30 bucks again!

As an aside, it's really a shame that the food being served took a backseat to the failed logistics of the event.  We couldn't even enjoy the food and the whole thing just left a bad taste in our mouths.""" ;

There were issues, with the car being 65 years old and original, but nothing unexpectedly wrong with the car. However the paperwork was screwed up, no one saw it, not the dealer and not me. Had it shipped to California with that paperwork it is likely I could never have registered the car in this state or if I could it would have cost a lot of time and money to do so. 

Because I used PPI the paperwork mistake was found before shipment and is being fixed by the dealer. Once I receive the corrected paperwork and the car I should have no troubles.

PPI did an excellent job taking numerous photographs as well as checking and documenting everything and follow up conversation discussing all the issues and findings.

Had I have gone to a nationally known brand it would have cost more and I doubt I could have gotten better or more professional and personalized service.

PPI is a great value for the money.

Thank you, PPI""" ;

Almost $400 for a standard main drain snake. Almost $200 for any other drains.

All of my sinks, showers and toilets were backed up. I had them snake the main drain. Solved my problem. Less than two weeks later my two bathroom sinks are backing up again. I call them, they show up over 2 hours late and tell me it will be another $200 because its a separate drain. Why didn't they tell me this may be an issue the first time they were supposed to fix ALL of the drains. Called customer service and manager was supposed to call me an never did, so I called back the next day. Did not hear back until a day after that (my sinks are sitting there clogged the whole time and I can't use them) Finally I get a call from GREG. He tried to talk over me, was rude and gave me the run around to try and shut me up. I told him I am a new homeowner and have lived in my house for just over a year and they just lost a customer for life. He did not seem to care or want to address the problem.

Go with a small plumbing company they will charge you 1/4 of the price. 

Also, instead of nasty Drain-O, go natural and pour dry banking soda down the problem sink, then vinegar and cover the hole, it will force the mixture down the pipe. 20-30 min after that pour a gallon of boiling water down the sink. Repeat this several times on big problem drains. Works like a freaking charm. Didn't believe it until I did it.""" ;

The appointment got bumped to 3:30 , then 4:30, then at 6:15 they call to say I'm "next" in queue and that the technician should  be there in about an hour !

I was so aggravated , I told them to cancel the job.

The guy was fairly friendly. Obviously hadn't had his coffee yet though. But, if it was my job to handle peoples feces all day I wouldn't be very chipper either. 

All in all, the job was done well. It only took him about 45 minutes to find the problem and clear the drains. He did leave a pretty big mess for me to clean up. I would have added at least 1 more star had I not had to clean up after the kid, the backed up drains, and him. 

Ended up paying $230 for the job.  Hope I wont need plumbing services again for a while, but next time I'll check with yelp 1st to see if there is a better plumbing company out there.""" ;

The experience with Roto-Rooter, and specifically our plumber, Al (703) has been without a doubt beyond our expectations when it comes to this type of work! We were having problems with a single bathroom in our home, and Al not only fixed the roots cracking into the pipe, but also was kind enough to check all other bathrooms on different floors to ensure that when he left, his job was done well AND right! We are 100% having them come back and work on the process and finishing of getting a new toilet installed and all that jazz. Even more so, we are already scheduling having them come back for a THIRD job in the summer so they can mend the cracked and dipped pipes we have from them being improperly placed by a different company. I will, and am recommending this company, and especially this awesome worker to anyone that needs any type of this work done! The moment Al showed up, even though it was practically a blizzard outside, was ready to go and get to work with a smile on his face! He even had the patience to explain the processes of all he had done and was going to do for us! THANK YOU ROTO-ROOTER! I wish I could give 10+ stars!" ;

They also said I would have to contact the city and convince them to shut off the water at the street. This sounded like a pretty high estimate for the fairly simple thing I needed done, so I called Royal Flush Plumbing for a second estimate.  They quoted $175-225, and this included fixing the main shutoff. And this did not require having the city come out to turn off the water. Somehow they were able to put a shutoff valve on there. So I have the spigot replaced and a working main shutoff, for 225 instead of 800. So Roto Rooter's estimate was almost quaruple what I ended up paying. I don't know if this is how their pricing is across the board, but this is how it worked out for the thing I had done. I would definitely recommend getting at least one other estimate." ;

Avoid disappointment and wasting time, by booking with another company that takes online reservations--same price--you'll find it.  Safeway Tours cares about cash in hand, not customer satisfaction.  Many Chinatown companies avoid credit card purchases to avoid cutting into their revenues.

We "booked" ahead, and had foregone other options, but when we showed up, our names were not on the list and the next free bus was in 3 hours, totally wasting our day.  When we called to complain, no staff had any memory of our call, even though it was 1.5 hours before.  We recited all the information, and they just said, "Sorry".""" ;

Our bus initially had some WIFI issue and the tour guide was telling the customers that we might be switching to another bus because of it.  This was very unexpected from a Chinese company and it's good service.  

The tour guide was very professional.....a bit too much talking.  Talked about every city that we pass by.    As always with these Chinese tour, it's always "see as much in as little amount of time as possible".  We visited 4 cities in 4 days and it felt very rushed.

I went in the summer to the states with safeway and some lady forgot where to meet up and the tour guide just totally left her and when we saw her on the street, the bus just kept on going, which was totally ridiculous and unsafe since she barely knew english. SAFEway tours? more like "If You Don't Meet At the Meeting Place On Time We'll Leave You Tours." (Don't worry the lady was safe she took the taxi to meet up with us -.- )
LORRRDDDD, do not DO NOT get me started on how fucking early you have to get up!!!!!!!!!!!! 5 AM?!  EVERYDAY & you barely have time to do anything for free time, just walk around take pictures for 30 minutes and meet up ON TIME.
Food?! buffet, chinese buffet lunch & dinner. You think you would get to relax at this time but NO you only have an HOUR to eat.... got me an upset stomach for the whole trip because of how fast i had to eat. 
The Tour Guide was not that bad, but this man kept coughing in the mic, he was rude, and was just soooooo uptight, it was like something was up his ass for 3 fricking days. 
All in all, just please do not waste your time and money on this useless tour. You think you're saving a lot of money but the experience is not worth it. I don't know how to express how badly this company is, it's not even fun, it's a packed schedule.

The cost is $20 return without a PAC card or $8 with a card. Once you arrive at the Niagara Falls Casino, they ask if you would like to sign up for the PAC card. It is free to sign up and means the next trip you take there is $8 instead of $20. Signing up to the card is simple, all you need is government Photo ID and they issue it on the spot. They don't force you to sign up if you don't want to, it's your choice :) 

The service was great, it was on time and very punctual for both of my trips. Ensure you call at least the day prior to make a reservation. You are designated a return time for your bus ride back however can change the time if required and get put on 'standby' for a different bus.

I took the bus down, stayed 1 night and took the bus back the following day with no trouble at all. If you need to change your return bus time, you need to ensure you check in with the Safeway stand to specify which bus you would like to take and they will alter your ticket accordingly. 

I'd highly recommend this service as its very affordable and easy, with lots of pick up locations. 

Be sure to book ahead, have Government Photo ID and have your $20 cash ready and you'll be all good :)""" ;

The tour guide Elly was really good. Actually looked like she enjoyed her job. Great service. Just like the other reviews outlets on every seat and wifi which kinda worked and kinda didn't at times but maybe it was just my problem.

The only problem although it was very enjoyable, we really only spend like 3 - 4 hours of activities at each destination (montreal, ottawa, quebec). Too little. The rest was bussing. I think it should have just been montreal, ottawa, and no qubec city so we don't waste time bussing so much and actually do stuff. Still great trip tho. 

The food was good. Some places were great food and really reflected the destination's culture and some were just mediocre buffet which is not a problem cus its not neccessary to beat eating amazing food every meal.

If you have a PAC card, your roundtrip fare will be $8. It used to be $7 or less but it appears that Safeway is continuously raising their prices due to growing demand.

The first section of seats are reserved for Platinum PAC card holders so don't bother sitting near the front as you'll be asked to move to the back. 

There are multiple pickup and drop off locations within the GTA at various times.

I recommend calling 2 days before your desired departure date to reserve a seat because waiting on standby is a gamble.

You can bring a backpack or suitcase on board. 

Your bus ticket is good for 48 hours if you choose to stay more than a day in Niagara. 

There is no option to purchase a one way ticket with Safeway, meaning that you can't purchase a ticket to just get from Niagara to the GTA.

As an employee of Cathay Pacific Airlines, the bus to Niagra Falls by safeway tours was recommended. Everything was fine when we first boarded the bus, however we were unaware at the time that the bus's main destination is the FallsView Casino. Since the legal gambling age in Toronto is 19, you are required to carry an ID with you to board the bus. However, our I.D.'s were not checked when we first boarded the bus. We had not brought them a long because we had not been told that we needed to do so. They let us board the bus anyway and never mentioned anything about it. After stopping at the falls, we were under the impression that the bus would be taking us back to the hotel. However, it was headed for the Casino. So upon trying to board the bus, for whatever reason, we were asked to show our IDs this time. The tour lady, named Annie, told us that we could not board the bus without ID. We told her that we were not asked to show ID before but she insisted that we could not board the bus. We made it clear that we were not intending to enter the casino anyway, and that we simply wanted to get there to back to our hotel. After arguing for some time, we realized that she was not going to let us back on the bus so we explained that we were not from Toronto and we simply wanted to get back to our hotel. She told us that the hotel was nearby and that we could ask around for directions. The ENTIRE time, she had a really bad attitude and was talking to us like we were children. She was very unprofessional. With that, the safeway tour bus left us stranded. Did I mention that it was raining? So after walking in the rain for 10 minutes, we stopped to ask someone to point us in the right direction to our hotel, turns out it was another 20 minutes away. Luckily, we were able to flag down a cab to make it the rest of the way to the hotel. So there's an extra amount of money we had to spend because of Safeway. After getting back to the hotel we went straight to the Safeways office there to complain. We explained everything that happened to the employees there. We were told that the manager was not there and that they would make sure to pass on our message to them. They wouldn't even provide us with the manager's contact information. This business is definitely SHADY. They do not care whatsoever about customer service. All they care is about getting your money, once they have that, they could give a crap about you.

Since I wasn't able to find a way to contact the management, I can only come online to let the public know of their ways so that you do not suffer the same horrible that experience I did.

If you go onto their website, they don't even have a contact us page or a feedback page. They have no email on the website, only a Canadian number that is only used to reserve and order tickets. Safe your time, sanity, and money.""" ;

            schema:reviewBody """If I can give Safeway Tours no stars, I would totally be doing it. It's New Year's Day and my boyfriend and I decided to go Niagara Falls to spend the day at the casino. We called the hotline to make reservations in advance for 3pm pickup at Chinatown Center. 2 buses arrived to pick up passengers on time but even then, we couldn't get on. They allowed gold and platinum members to board first, which I completely understand. I figured that after boarding gold/platinum members, the tour guide would ask people who reservations to board next. Afterall, making reservations would actually mean seats were reserved. The girl responsible didn't even asked who made reservations and who didn't, she just picked and chose at her own discretion who can board and who can't. I went up to her explaining that my boyfriend and I had made reservations this morning and her response was RUDE. She said reservations must be made the night before 11pm and anything made in the morning does not count. She even suspected that I was lying in order to get on. I called customer service on the spot and spoke to a lady to see if that was true. After receiving confirmation that our reservations were actually made, the lady from customer service said she would call the girl. I was placed on hold for 15 minutes, while she tried to call the tour guide. The tour guide did not pick up. So while still being on the phone with customer service, I walked up to the tour guide to tell her to answer her phone because head office is calling her. She completely ignored me and said the bus is full and told me to call and make reservations. What nonsense! 

The lady from customer service then tried to explain to me that it must be because there were too many unexpected gold/platinum members that the tour guide didn't honour my seats even though reserved. That was not the case. They were seats leftover. She just didn't bother to look into who made reservations. The tour guides name is Savvy (or however you spell her name). She neglected my complaints and explanation, and she was completely RUDE in the process.

What is the point of calling the reservation hotline and make reservations when the tour guide can pick and choose who can board at their own discretion? My experience with Safeway Tours is TERRIBLE. Absolutely unorganized and not professional.""" ;

Generally the staff is nice.
But if you try to use them on Holiday/Long weekends Look Out.
They can get pretty inconsiderate, irritable and just downright abusive.

Good idea right $30 for a return trip to Fallsview Casino.

So I call them up and arrange a pick up from near where I live. Their website has a map which allows you to see where the closest pick up point is and also see the schedule which is actually quite regular. 

The telephone service was quick, arrange a reservation time and the only bad thing was getting a strict warning to "not be late" which I thought was not at all needed.

So the next day the coach was on time, quickly boarded and off we went, with two more pick ups on the way. 

The coach itself was nice, and with the hot weather we been having it was nice that the coach was cool. My only bad point of the coach was the silly idea of playing a movie when it would never finish in the time it takes to get to Niagra. They would be better off playing some sports or in my case an instruction video on how to gamble properly!

On arrival to Fall view Casino the lady on the coach asked if I wanted to sign up for the PAC card, this basically means that any time I wish to return it will only cost me $5 return to take the same coach journey! Bargain basement! Only catch is you do have to spend sometime in the casino losing money lol; which is what I went ahead and did.

Overall it is a good service they provide, very regular from early morning pickups to late. They do when you arrive give you a time to return, and since they want to keep you at the casino really long the return time might be too late. You can however request an earlier coach which is what i did by three hours.

Your free to go check out the falls and anything else in Niagara, but once you got that PAC card make sure you take sometime to use it on the machines or at the tables in the casino. Even after losing a couple of hundred bills to the slots and roulette they didn't check mine on return.

Will probably go again once I have practise my poker face in the mirror or banged my head to become autistic.""" ;

When we got to the bus stop, the hosts asked for my name, looked on her sheet, and said I didn't reserve a seat. She later called head office to check, and indeed I did book 2 seats, but the lady on the phone didn't pass along the info. The hosts were very strict with other people as well, since they didn't book a seat, however the hosts let her on. After the 4 stops the bus made, the bus was packed right to the back. They played a Disney movie for the trip too!

When we arrived at the casino, the lady swiped our PAC cards and gave us 1 point towards cash back. 

Overall the bus service is a nice connivence. $5 is really cheap. There are outlets to charge your phone if you'd like. 
A recommendation I would give is reserve your seats a good 3-4 hours in advance, even the day before if you can. The bus is usually full going down in the early mornings to mid-afternoons, but the return trip is not so busy.""" ;

Sears, after at least thirty minutes on each call due to a terrible automated system, said they couldn't come out again for another week.

I called again that day to make sure they would call the cell and again after they had missed the repair window.  I never got a call and a repair was never made.  I called that night to complain.  The representative who answered said they would call me back, no call was made.  I called the next day and spent an hour and forty minutes being switched around to different department including the \"escalation department.\"  I was never allowed to talk to a manager, and they said the earliest I could schedule a repair was a week and a half away.  This means for over a month I will have no refrigerator.  They have made no attempts to rectify the situation.

She sends me a text (sometimes adorable pictures) to let me know how the visit went and always leaves a note on the counter with details of the visit.  The most important thing is that Lucy LOVES Liz and I know she looks forward to her walks.  I always have peace of mind knowing that my pup is receiving the best care.

Today, 12/26, Liz texted me to tell me that she changed her mind and that she doesn't like coming Uptown. We are going out of town late 12/30. When I expressed that this would put me into a bind, she responded cold heartedly "it's 3 days later and you have a week".

I wouldn't have minded her turning down my business the first time I told her that we've moved. I do not appreciate her agreeing to tend to my cats and then "change her mind" a few days - not a week - before I go out of town. Now I'm scrambling to find a new sitter within the next three days.

My brother found it for all of us to stay at while in Madison for my uncle's funeral.  It's a little further out of town than I normally like but it's five minutes away from TownEast Mall and places to eat so it was perfect for the occasion.

Right off the bat, because I have Hilton HHonors card, I got 500 bonus points and a chocolate bar and a bottle of water from the staff.  That was exactly what I needed.
The room is large and had a fridge, microwave and a dishwasher.  None of which I needed but good to know.

The free WiFi was such a joy and it was fast too.  Plenty of space to lay out my laptop and external hard drive.  

Bed was comfortable although i did get bit up by something - fleas maybe. Flat screen was new with plenty of channels.

The free breakfast was also good - cereals, oatmeals, bagels, fruit, muffins, coffee, OJ - all perfectly suited for us.

After the funeral we returned and all of us sat in their 'family room' to play cards and have some cocktails.  Everyone was totally cool with that.

I imagine that in the spring and summer this hotel stays very busy.

One thing though, for some reason, they are not listed on the wall at the airport for their shuttle service.  You might want to call in advance.

If I ever travel with a large group to Madison again, I'm sure we will stay there.  I highly recommend it!""" ;

The parking lot is designed very awkwardly. Entry to the hotel is up a few stairs which makes luggage handling a struggle.
The bathtubs are the plastic surround type. The bottom of mine was cracked.
I didn't see a water leak but it was concerning. I of course reported it to management for follow up.

They also sprayed my bridesmaids before the wedding. 

I loved that they came to me. They set up a tent in an open space to do the spray tan and it is mess free. 

Having a person spray you instead of a machine operated booth allows for a much more even tan. She even sprayed my face less than my body so I wouldn't look too dark.

The girl who came to my house was extremely knowledgeable and had great tips for me and my bridal party. They also offer group rates. 

I highly recommend Tan on the Run!

TIP: Make sure to follow the pre and post tan instructions on their website.""" ;

I know its just $1.75 and not a big deal, but it was to them! The cashier called another cashier and she said that I should have complained then and told the cashier to make sure and charge me for the cheese and she walked away. Can you say RUDEEE!!!

They were prepared quickly, I'm glad I checked the bag because 2 tacos were missing. I went back in and told the girl that 2 tacos were missing....she responded by asking me why...lol why?? I thought to myself...that's a damn good question..(not the smartest one of the bunch) I gave her my receipt and she checked everything. I got my tacos and left. I am giving this place 1 star because as a consumer I feel customer service should be #1 priority for the business and business owner. It clearly isn't for some people including this girl. It seemed like she didn't want to be there, if I was the owner I would reevaluate the employees. Get rid of the ones who dont want to be there and get some people who do. I know its not everyone's life dream to work in a taco shop but I have met some passionate people in the past that put 120% into all they do and it shows. Some past reviews have commented on the same issue....that was in 2015...c'mon B.O. If you need a payment processing system I know the right people who can hook you up. 
In conclusion I won't be coming back to this place. The food was good not great, another negative having to pay for every single miniscule thing. Which means your business must not be doing that great if you have to pinch every penny. I wish you and your business the best.""" ;

The menudo offered on the weekends is great as well (perfect hangover or cold remedy)!  This is one of the best grab & go spots in town or you could eat inside if you are not planning on staying very long as it is small and sometimes tends to get very crowded.  

Warning to those who are scared of sketchy neighborhoods.  You will probably be asked for change in the parking lot and you might run into a gangster or two.  :)  Just beware, the tacos are soo worth it!  

If you want a great burrito, a simple bean, cheese and carne asada will satisfy your craving.  

Would have given the place 5 stars but there is no inside bathroom and their horchata is not ALWAYS up to par (try the Jamaica drink, though).  Also, bring cash - there is a fee for paying with debit/credit card.""" ;

Also they are cash only and you have to withdrawl cash with a 2 dollar fee plus whatever the bank will charge me. That PLUS they charge for drink refills.

So I tell them that I don't care who put me on hold anymore, all I want is someone to take my order. She then explains that the calls are placed on hold until they are done helping the person in front of then. I tell her, i highly doubt that its taken him (I point at guy at register) 14 plus minutes to order. So again, i ask that my order be taken. She then tells me that I have to wait until she's done helping the people in line. So I get in the back of the line wait till its my turn. Then when the cashier is taking my order the phone rings. She picks it up and takes a phone order. After that first call ended the phone ringe again, and she takes ANOTHER phone order before she finishes with mine. What the fuck!

I was glad when they remodeled the place a few years back 'cause the place was getting dumpy. It's always been a cash only place, so the reviews that complain about that apparently can't read the big signs on all the doors saying \"CASH ONLY\". So why only 4 stars? The cashier staff is horrible! The place is busy, but they have only one cashier? And that person has to take and give phone in orders. To top it off, the cashier is a young lady who's both overwhelmed and nonchalant. Often taking care off her personal matters when there's 5 or 6 parties in line. Management needs to put in another register and run them with better professionalism to get that 5th star." ;

There is a young man "Abel,"  who is real cool.  For the almost 20 times I have been here, I still have not gotten any bad service, so I am sorry for those that have not had the experience I have had. I recommend Tuesday nights!""" ;

I found out about TPB online and I really liked the concept of being able to choose what you'd like weekly, and I didn't really want to buy into a CSA. TPB hand-delivers your items, and they have a nice variety of produce, fruits, meats and even different sweets and snacks you can add to your boxes.

The very first box my mom received was decent (note: you have to provide your own box)... except it was missing an item, and the quality of one bunch of fruit was poor/damaged. She informed TPB about her damaged fruit and also about the missing item, and they said they would get back to her about it. I definitely understand that mistakes happen, and items are overlooked... so I didn't see this as a big deal. I'm thinking TPB would at the least just include the missing item (or a reasonable equivalent) in the next weeks box, let her know... and problem solved. Nah...

A few days passed with no follow up. So I shot out a quick e-mail, and I received a response back the same day letting me know they would look into it. Cool. However, a few more days passed with no follow up! Nah... Meanwhile, my mom received her next weeks box, which was fine. Problem is she is still sans the missing item from the first delivery, and she still has no idea when or if TPB plans to resolve the problem.

I'm someone who believes customer service is equally, if not more important than the product received. I want to have my concerns or problems quickly addressed and handled... especially if I'm a new customer! Most memorable to me are the businesses who not only want to make sure you are completely satisfied, but actually follow up and quickly resolve your concerns. To this day, I still haven't heard back from TPB about the missing item. 

I shouldn't have to contact a business more than once, let alone twice... to get what I paid for. I have cancelled my membership. Mom wasn't happy about it, but she knows how I feel about spending my money on products offered from companies with bad customer service. Now Yelp knows too haha. Some are necessary evils, others aren't. I may have 99 problems, but TPB ain't one...""" ;

Enter The Produce Box - I'd read a story about this company in Raleigh and was very excited when they expanded to Charlotte! I signed up as soon as they opened here and it was a wonderful decision! Each week I get an amazing box of fresh, organic, local produce - beautiful greens, crisp apples, squash, kohlrabi, the list goes on and on. It's basically a CSA that delivers to you, with the added convenience of online ordering so that you control what you get! I've gotten rave reviews from friends about how good my salads look at work, and I just used some of the spinach for a community dinner that my neighbors loved! They even include a weekly newsletter that explains how best to take care of your goodies and cook them (in case you don't know!)

I signed up for the service in February after moving to a new house and thinking about how I would like to start cooking more. I have two small children, so going to farmer's markets can be a hassle, but I love getting fresh, locally grown produce to cook with. When I found out about The Produce Box, I knew it was the answer I was looking for! I go online, pick out which produce box I want or create my own box, and then just a few days later it's delivered to my front door! It's so easy and convenient, and I love that I'm supporting local farms while eating healthy too." ;

We were told this is the oldest theatre in North Carolina, pretty cool it hasn't been replaced like most everything else in CLT. 

We went to see Memphis last weekend & were impressed. The tickets were all the same price; you can choose your seats online & pick up your tickets when you arrive. I recommend sitting a few rows back. As tempting as the front row is, you don't have the best view. 

They have some snacks (popcorn, candy, etc.), non-alcoholic drinks + wine/beer. We were surprised how reasonable the prices were. They have a small parking lot, but street parking is allowed. 

The only downside was the seats weren't comfy and the bathrooms were small (2 stalls, I believe). Other than that, I'm a fan and hope to go back soon.""" ;

I had the pleasure of catching Theatre Charlotte's production of RENT - filled with incredibly talented local actors and actresses. The theater itself is filled with fairly comfy seats for approximately 220 people, leading to intimate shows but still offering great lighting, sound etc. Also, pricing is very fair, especially for the high quality production I witnessed with RENT - tickets were $24 for adults! 

As Jimmy mentioned, concessions are surprisingly affordable with wine or beer at $4. Compare that to other theaters in Charlotte and this is pretty close to a steal. This is most definitely a gem in Charlotte and I plan to head over to Theatre Charlotte much more often to enjoy great productions put on and acted by volunteers in our fine city!""" ;

Once you find it (you may miss it the first drive by), parking can be a slight issue. The cement lot next to the building (up a fairly decent hill) is small and fills up fast, but apparently you can park right on Queens or at some of the businesses around the corner (since most of the shows are after work hours/during the weekend). You walk in and the ticket booth is straight ahead, I believe it opens 1 hour before each show time. Then, there is an area filled with couches, cafe tables and chairs, and a concession stand. Popcorn ($2), candies, water, soda, beer and wine are available. I didn't catch the price on the glasses of wine but they were definitely nice sized pours. Food/beverages are allowed in the theater. 

The theater is small, only holds about 220, and all the seats are considered orchestra. (no balcony, no mezzanine, just one floor) The ushers open the doors about 20 minutes before showtime, giving them plenty of time to help you find your seat (which can be a little confusing on your first visit since the seats are lettered and numbered identically on both sides of the theater, but with the added designation of either Orchestra Left or Orchestra Right... sometimes there is some seat swapping involved) 

The night I was there a large group arrived right at curtain and they actually started the play a little late to accommodate them. (That was definitely a first for me) But this is a very laid back theater, community and volunteer driven, who want you and your children to enjoy the show as much as possible. I don't know if this happens at every show, but the cast came out after and mingled with the guests, and that was definitely an nice bonus. 

I look forward to visiting Theatre Charlotte again!""" ;

Don't count on parking in the theater's small lot, but a business around the corner allows parking in its lot and helpfully turns its lot's lights on so you feel safer walking back to your car from the theater.

The interior space is equally unassuming, but there are a number of tables there to sit and have a drink and snack from the concession (which accepts cash and credit cards). I found it quaint and very befitting of community theater.

Plan your bathroom breaks, gentlemen, because unlike many public facilities there are only two toilets in the men's room. So, you can see the odd sight of a line for the men's room that is nearly as long as the line for the ladies' room during the intermission (thought the men's clears faster).

There is not a bad seat in the theater, which is only about 20 rows deep by maybe 20 seats wide by my rough estimate. The performance was well done within the limits of community theater. If I lived in Charlotte I would enjoy attending shows here regularly.""" ;

My husband and I had arrived there a little later than we had expected, so I was dropped off at the front of the building so that he could find a parking spot.  I guess that's why I took off one star.  It appeared that this place doesn't have a lot of space for parking.  Too bad they don't own the gravel lot right beside it, because then people would be able to park their cars there instead of on the side of the street.

I walked in and saw the ticket booth straight to my right hand side.  Very good so I didn't have to worry about where I was going.  The person inside nicely informed me that I had to go to the Will Call table for my tickets, which was located directly across from the ticket booth, about 3 steps away.  Perfect!  It wasn't a struggle to go somewhere else for my tickets.  

Inside looked nice and had a homely feel to it.  I didn't get to enjoy it all the way because my husband and I decided to just go to and take our seats.  But let me tell you all that I did get to see.  It was a nice and opened room, with what looked like very big comfy couches.  If I was a little kid at that moment, I would've ran over and tested out the couches by jumping all over them.  Unfortunately, I'm an adult now.  Oh well.  Inside the waiting room, there was also a beautiful piano near the front entrance.  It was pretty to see when I walked in.

Now inside the theater, I thought it was great.  It had high ceilings, which was great for when they wanted to use certain lighting.  I liked the open space.  The seats were super rad.  They were the folding seats (I'm not quite sure what they're called, but you have to push them down to sit in it), and were comfortable.  It didn't hurt that the seats were also a pretty purple color, my favorite!  So kudos for that.  Also, I think that with all the seats, you can see the stage very well.  I love when I can see stuff and not have to break my neck trying to see all the characters.

The production itself was amazing.  The performers were wonderful with so much energy for the show.  It was great because there was a lot of funny parts and I just had to actually "Laugh Out Loud."  The set was also amazing, and I loved how they were able to use the lighting in certain ways to transition.  

I think that everyone should go and try to catch a show because this is a nice theatre, and also, ticket sales help this theatre out a lot so go and support them!""" ;

No, they don't have the grandeur of the Belk, and there isn't even the intimacy of the Booth - on the outside it doesn't look like much more than a house, which is why you can miss it so easily (I have done so many times).

Even once you are inside, the lobby doesn't look like much more than a living room. But past the doors, there is a nice-sized space, and an ample stage, with an impressive array of workmanship backstage as well.

The building is quite old, we were told that the theater has operated there for 71 years! The dress is casual, I felt a bit overdressed in my pencil skirt. 

We were greeted warmly by the staff upon arrival and were able to get a nice malbec for about $4. Be warned, this is a cash only venue...with no atm in the building. 

We sauntered on to the front row (hey these are the best seats in the house!) and enjoyed the performance. The actress who played Sister Aloysius stood out among the three person cast. Let's just say if you can play a part that Meryl Streep took on and make it look every bit as fabulous you've got talent! Though there was no intermission, I had no problem staying alert throughout the duration. These folks can act! 

I look forward to seeing another production soon!""" ;

We arrived early for the show so parking wasn't that big of a problem. The parking spaces are minimal and they are first come first serve. It is close to downtown which makes it convenient for people to attend a show after work and the prices seem to be reasonable. The theater was large but it was in an okay condition. It seemed like it wasn't being used much because the surroundings seem to be a little dusty. I'm giving this theater 3 out of 5 stars because there was plenty of seating inside but the decor was outdated and simple. Regardless of the cosmetic conditions that we noticed, we did have fun and enjoyed the show. We will be going back." ;

I did get a call back from a technician with a story on why they were not there yet well past my appt time so we'll be going with another company as tiger air is unreliable. 
It took a couple days to get the service scheduled because the live person you get to talk to is just an answering service that can't schedule an appt., so if the technician calls you back to schedule the appt and you aren't there, you have to call the answering service back and give all the same information because that's not stored anywhere.

Your problem is explained to you in such a way that you actually understand what you're having fixed/replaced.

The concept is simple: they cook giant pizzas and sell them slice by slice. The pizzas on offer change regularly and the service is very casual (no cutlery etc).

Right now the pizza is really nice there, the dough is a mix of crusty and fluffy, which I like better than very thin bases. Try the Salame Piccante or the Boscaiola!

Now the only problem here, is that for less than a fiver for two slices and a drink, it's almost cheaper than my uni's canteen. I'm not sure eating pizza every day is very good for my line, so I'm obviously not going daily, but for the price and taste, it's really hard no to!""" ;

I really enjoy going to this laid back pizzeria. There is a good selection of pizza to buy by the slice or also by the half or whole pizza. I was here with seven other people and for ¬£40 we had a whole margherita to share and it was more than enough to go round. The pizzas are baked in big rectangular trays so a whole pizza is a lot. They have various toppings, both vegetarian and meat and also offer cheeseless pizza.

They have a fairly decent drinks menu for a pizzeria, wine by the glass or bottle and birra moretti on tap. The coffee is good, quite close to real Italian coffee and both the deserts I have tried were good (tiramisu and rhum babas). 

The prices are very reasonable. Lunch with beer or wine for less than ¬£10.

It is also a nice place to sit. High ceilings and light in a nice old building in the lovely Bruntsfield. There is a long table which is great for groups but also smaller booths and tables for a more intimate meal. It is quite casual though, so maybe not the best place for a romantic first date.""" ;

The staff were friendly, knowledgeable and the helpful.

However we were here for the pizza that came recommended as the "best pizza slice in town", so the decor etc can be ignored lunch time hungry pangs were superseding such pleasantries. We were here for the pizza I would have taken a picture but by the time we got back to the office hunger had overtaken, so the slices were wolfed down. I opted for the 2 slices and a coke deal which came out at ¬£4.95. Well priced for a lunch deal, but the pizza is amazing so for ¬£4.95 it's a bargain in my head compared to the mediocre pizza I have had elsewhere recently. Thumbs up from me, this place is great.

So this time, with about a week in advance, I needed a super-special, super-delicious cake for a dear friend (who also bakes). I knew I couldn't let her down so I searched for a 'from scratch' baker in the PHX area. That's how I came across Ugly Cakes. 

Cindy The Baker @Ugly Cakes is an absolute joy to do business with! She is sweet beyond compare and professional too, with over 20 years experience in baking and catering. 

I perused her website, www.uglycakery.com, and kept coming back to the scrumptious pic of the German Chocolate cake. I don't care for chocolate (I know, I'm crazy) but this cake looked like the perfect blend of coconut, pecan deliciousness. So I ordered via telephone and picked the cake up on party day. The cake looked exactly like the picture, moist and delectable. I could not wait to taste it!

I was very impressed with the packaging of the cake as it was expertly placed on a pink cake round then put into a clear, plastic cake container. The cake round was the perfect size and the cake - despite the 50+ mile trip in the car - never nudged into the container and arrived in mint condition. Bakeries never seem to get the packaging right and on many occasions, I've arrived to gatherings with smudged cakes and mashed up desserts.

Suffice it to say, the cake was a HUGE hit! Super-moist, rich and a perfectly balanced sweetness with a mild, buttery chocolate (3 tier) cake that allowed for the gooey coconut pecan frosting to shine through. There was no weird aftertaste or waxy feel to the upper palate either as the ingredients that went into making the wonderful cake were few, simple, and clean. 

The truth: I hated having to give the leftover cake away to the birthday girl. I know, I'm mean. But it was so, so good! 

Cannot wait for the next special occasion as I will definitely be back to Ugly Cakes.""" ;

All of our children have birthday's approximately a week apart and our anniversary falls in the middle of them.  It's been tradition in our house to have red velvet cake since our first wedding anniversary and it flowed into the kids birthdays.  There has not been a year without red velvet cake since.  

I stumbled upon Ugly Cakes and was drawn to the fact that all of Cindi's cakes are baked from family recipes and baked at home.....AND red velvet cake was on the menu!  No fuss, no muss for extravagantly decorated cakes but more love and hard work put into the taste with a personal touch.  With only a few days to order something, I reached out online & Lindi responded quickly and kindly.  The customer service and responsiveness from mother and daughter was wonderful.  

Not being there I, myself, was not able to taste the cake but via face time while they were eating (there were 6 of them at this point) I watched them all devour Cindi's cake with pleasure and the verbal feedback was that it was delicious and on par!

Thank you Ugly Cakes for helping me bring a little bit of home to my son for his birthday!""" ;

The other huge reason I picked this cakery because of the name and the logo! The cupcake has a paper sac over his head! I can do business with someone like that.

Not only was Lindi super responsive (lightning fast actually), she was accommodating and even provided me with a detailed confirmation of our delivery. I'm absolutely impressed! When I need to order cupcakes for clients in Phoenix, Arizona again, I will be reaching out to Lindi and the team at Ugly Cakes.

For me personally, I compare this area of NDG as smaller English "plateau Mont-Royal"; it has some underrated restaurants and bars. Ye Olde Orchard is a cozy friendly Celtic Pub, a great place to go with friends or coworkers. 

They are currently having a "Curry Festival" where they serve different curry dishes. It comes with a salad. I ordered their butter chicken. If I have to be honest I would say it's decent coming from a Celtic Pub. The chicken was tender. The sauce was not too spicy. It came with rice and Naan bread which were decent but not amazing. Again, it's not an Indian restaurant so don't expect for an Indian authenticity but it adds a nice variety to their menu. The price and portion ratio is a plus. You get your money worth.

Overall this Ye Olde Orchard Pub is a great place to just "chill" with friends. The waiters and waitresses are friendly easy to talk to. 

Also, you might want to get there a bit before 8pm on a Monday because they have Trivia quizz. I highly suggest you to go if you have a broad knowledge about random facts. You can win prizes for your table if you win!""" ;

This is a pub based on the history of Montreal traditions with the combination of the French, English, Scottish, and Irish.  This is the original location as they have expanded years ago to the Prince Arthur area and downtown Montreal.

As far as I can recall the chefs are of Sri Lankan origin so there are a lot of curry and spicy dishes available on the specials menu and the regular menu.  I'd walked in on one of my occasional visits to Montreal and 2/3 items on the menu were curry based.

Lunch for me was a cheese burger, fries, and a coke.  All was good as usual, just as I remember it.

I stopped in to check their prices for ammunition and I was very pleased. They carry this in the store and it's a good $2 a box cheaper than the place where I had been buying. And even better, Dick's has a full selection in stock where the other place seems to be lacking at times.

Very friendly service, the guy who helped me with the ammo is a gun enthusiast who was friendly and willing to talk with me about this particular brand for a few minutes.

Yes, they have bats and balls and shorts and tshirts and lots of other stuff designed to get you all hot and sweaty while you're running or playing or whatever it is that you thin people do to burn off calories.

Also a tip - when you're heading to their website, you need to make sure you spell out the entire DicksSportingGoods.com. If you just use first word, you get... something different.""" ;

My wife, the most fanatical football fan that I know celebrated her birthday last week. While she is a dyed in the wool Pittsburgh Fan, what she wanted was a #59 Carolina Panter;s Kuechly Jersey.

Found it at Dick's.  Had to look to find the right size but the staff was great and helped us find it right away.

Store is well laid out, very well organized and the store personnel are outstanding. The know their merchandize and answer questions quickly and accurately.

That said, with Dick's only about 10 minutes from my house, this made for one of the easiest birthday shopping trips ever.""" ;

While a lot of these t-shirts were pricey because they were Jordan or Nike brand, they'll likely go on sale once the confetti has been swept. Dick's usually has really great clearance sales, as I've picked up cleats for flag football for around $30. Anything sport related, Dick's will have. Customer service is always great as well." ;

Supposedly this is one of the Charlotte Dick's "premier running specialty stores" so they care a lot more running shoe brands like Mizuno, Brooks, Asics that you typically can't find in a regular Dick's.

For being in a mall it's a bit unusual but they've got lots of guns and ammo to check out. Otherwise, it's usually very dead/empty and not heavily stocked on anything else other than clothes. I recently came through a few times checking out bikes and their inventory is pretty pathetic in that department. Staff is often also hard to find here, especially if you're on the bottom floor. They do at least have the buttons you can push at various stations that will call someone to your area pretty quick.

I'm not a fan of the prices. I guess it's just a fact of life with specialty stores like this but they're high. This could also be an effect of having only the super popular sports brands such as Nike, Adidas, Under Armour, etc. as part of their primary offerings. As a result though, there's not much variety to pick from if you're looking for clothes and shoes that are specific for runners (in my case). But if you need football, basketball or baseball ('Murica!) clothes they've got 'em.

On the local front this store - and most Dick's stores - do a decent job. They try to make it feel at least a bit like home. Maps of local areas are painted onto the pillars and they have all the sports gear for the local teams. Make sure if you do lots of shopping here you get the free "Scorecard" that will give you free gift cards for high dollar purchases.""" ;

Great layout, lots of options, styles and fashions. You can get all sweaty and still look good when you gear up here. I'm a fan of the always fully-loaded clearance racks. They have just about anything sports-wise except the more extreme outdoors stuff at a Dick's (like kayaking, mountaineering and spelunking they don't have that stuff). Spring is upon us so get in here and add a color-splash to that work-out getup. Shoes, shorts, shirts, pants, under armor, jackets, etc. Workout machines for the colder months and gear for the outdoors. Even a good array of bike-related stuff - right up my alley.""" ;

I've ended up finding a couple cheap items here while he's browsing. I bought a nice swimsuit top for 11 bucks, for example. Dick's has pretty much every sporting good or athletic clothing item you could ever think of. With a large climbing wall in the middle of the store, it's a pretty experiential, fun place." ;

            schema:reviewBody """I have been to this Dicks several times, and can never find what I am looking for. Most recently I tried to buy a swimsuit, but 15 minutes of searching yielded nothing. It took me only 5 minutes to find the watersports section, but inexplicably they weren't there. "Outdoors" didn't have anything either. I finally managed to track down an employee, and he assured me that they were "over there", pointing across the store. Now, this store is about 40,000 square feet. I walked "over there" and searched for another few minutes before asking another employee. This one pointed up! Apparently "over there" had meant the second floor. I made sure to get better directions this time, and found the swimsuits in only a few more minutes.

And that experience is typical, unless you are shopping for one of their specialties. Camping? They've got you covered. Kayaking? You can't miss it! Weightlifting? Easy-ish. Running? Eh, good luck. Cycling? Be prepared to search for it. Swimming? Don't even bother - order online and you'll be much happier. Despite the enormity of the store, they only pay lip service to most sports. If you are picky about your equipment you'd be better off at a specialty store.""" ;

The speciality running shoe places really dropped the ball for me in 2011, so I decided to buy a set of top end Nike running shoes at Dicks.

Got the service I wanted....and the question I had answered and I bought the shoes.  Even got a $10 coupon for my next purchase over $50.  Not bad....not bad at all.""" ;

He said I could pay $20 or rent it for 30 minutes. I was bummed because they had the driver I was looking for.I told him I guess I would ride over to Golfsmith or Galaxy and used their simulator- he said they had a better choices too.
